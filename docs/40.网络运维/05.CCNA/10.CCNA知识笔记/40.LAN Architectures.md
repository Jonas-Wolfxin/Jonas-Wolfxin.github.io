>   -   You have studied various network technologies: routing, switching, STP, EtherChannel, OSPF, FHRPs, switch security features, etc. 
>       + Now let’s look at some basic network design/architecture 
>
>   -   There are standard ‘best practices’ for network design. 
>       + However there are few universal ‘correct answers’. 
>       + The answer to most general questions about network design is ‘it depends’. 
>
>   -   In the early stages of your networking career, you probably won’t be asked to design networks yourself. 
>
>   -   However, to understand the networks you will be configuring and roubleshooting it’s important to know some basics of network design.

## Common terminologies

>   These are general terms, not only for LAN design but for connections between devices in general.
>
>   -   **Star**: When **several devices all connect to one central device** we can draw them in a ‘star’ shape like below, so this is often called a ‘star topology’.
>
>   -   **Full Mesh**: When each device is connected to each other device.
>
>   -   **Partial Mesh**: When some devices are connected to each other, but not all.

## 2-Tier and 3-Tier LAN Architecture

### Two-Tier Campus LAN Design

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202305141553739.png" alt="image-20230514155348423" style="zoom:33%;" />

>   -   The two-tier LAN design consists of two hierarchical layers: 
>       + **Access Layer**
>       + **Distribution Layer**
>   -   The two tier design is also called a ‘**Collapsed Core**’ design because it omits a layer that is found in the three tier design, the **Core Layer**. Or more accurately, it combines the two together into one layer. In a collapsed core design, the **Distribution Layer** is sometimes called the **Core-Distribution Layer** or **Aggregration Layer**.
>
>   ###### Access Layer:
>
>   -   the layer that *end hosts connect to* (PCs, printers, cameras, etc.);
>   -   typically **Access Layer Switches** have lots of ports for end hosts to connect to;
>   -   **QoS marking is typically done here**, because it's a good practice to mark traffic as early as possible in the network.
>   -   **Security services** like port security, DAI, etc are typically performed here, too.
>   -   switchports might be PoE-enabled for wireless APs, IP phones, etc.
>
>   ###### Distribution Layer: 
>
>   -   aggregates connections from the Access Layer Switches;
>       -   Depending on how many end hosts there are, your network might have many access layer switches.
>       -   Those connections are then usually aggregated to **a redundant pair of two distribution layer switches**;
>   -   Typically, this is the border between Layer 2 and Layer 3 in the network. 
>       -   So, the distribution layer switches run both **Layer 3 protocols** such as OSPF and **Layer 2 protocols** such as spanning tree. 
>       -   This is not always the case, but usually the connections from the access layer switches to the distribution layer switches are Layer 2 connections, and then end hosts use the SVIs on the distribution layer switches as their default gateways.
>   -   used to connect to services such as Internet, WAN, etc.

>   ##### Relate this back to those common topology terminologies

>   ##### Problem of Two-Tier Campus LAN Design
>
>   Now, if the network gets larger we might have many distribution layers connecting to different parts of the LAN. 
>
>   -   In large LAN networks with many distribution layer switches(for example in separate buildings across a campus), the number of connections required between distribution layer switches grows rapidly. 
>   -   This makes it much more difficult and complicated to scale the network, to make it bigger. 
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202305141601495.png" alt="image-20230514160148356" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   -   So, to help scale large LAN networks you can add a **Core Layer**.
>       -   Cisco recommends adding a Core Layer if there are more than **three** distribution layers in a single location. 
>       -   These core layer switches are a pair of very **powerful and fast** switches. 
>

### Three-Tier Campus LAN Design

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202305141613372.png" alt="image-20230514161346976" style="zoom:33%;" />

>   -   The three-tier LAN design consists of three hierarchical layers: 
>       -   Access Layer 
>       -   Distribution Layer 
>       -   Core Layer
>
>   ###### Core Layer:
>
>   -   Connects Distribution Layers together in large LAN networks
>   -   The focus of this layer is **speed**, you might hear the term ‘**fast transport**’ as being a goal of the core layer.
>       -   CPU-intensive operations such as security features, QoS marking and classification, etc should be avoided at this Layer. We just want fast forwarding of packets, nothing extra.
>   -   Connections are all Layer 3. No spanning-tree!
>   -   Should maintain connectivity throughout the LAN even if devices fail
>       -   Because it’s the backbone of the LAN, redundancy of devices and connections is very important.



## Spine-Leaf Architecture (Data Center)

>   -   Data centers are dedicated spaces/buildings used to store computer systems such as servers and network devices mounted onto the racks.
>   -   Traditional data center designs used a three-tier architecture(Access-Distribution-Core).
>       -   This traditional design worked well when most of the traffic in the data center was **north-south**.
>   -   With the precedence(地位升高) of **virtual servers**, applications are often deployed in a distributed manner (across multiple physical servers), which increases the amount of **East-West traffic** in the data center.
>
>   >   ##### Traffic Directions:
>   >
>   >   -   **North-South** traffic refers to traffic from Access Layer up to Distribution Layer, Core Layer, and then perhaps *out to the Internet* or *back down south to the other Distribution and Access Layers*.
>   >       -   These other sections of the LAN are drawn off to the side so the traffic doesn’t look north-south when drawing the arrows in this diagram, but this is north-south traffic too.
>   >   -   **East-West** traffic refers to traffic between these servers in the same part of the network like this, *the traffic doesn’t go out to other parts of the LAN* or *out to the Internet*.
>   >
>   >   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202305141706629.png" alt="image-20230514170617510" style="zoom:48%;" />
>
>   -   The traditional three-tier architecture led to bottlenecks in **bandwidth** as well as **variability in the server-to-server latency** depending on the path the traffic takes.
>
>   -   To solve this, **Spine-Leaf architecture** (also called **Clos architecture**) has become prominent in data centers.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202305141724614.png" alt="image-20230514172426481" style="zoom:35%;" />
>
>   -   There are some rules about **Spine-Leaf** architecture:
>       -   **Every Leaf switch is connected to every Spine switch**, which also means *Every Spine switch is connected to every Leave switch*.
>       -   Leaf switches do not connect to other Leaf switches. Also, Spine switches do not connect to other Spine switches.
>       -   End hosts (servers etc.) only connect to Leaf switches.
>   -   The features of **Spine-Leaf** architecture:
>       -   The path taken by traffic is randomly chosen to balance the traffic load among the Spine switches.
>       -   Each server is separated by the same number of ‘hops’ (except those connected to the same Leaf), providing **consistent latency** for East-West traffic.
>

## SOHO (Small Office/Home Office)

>   -   Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) refers to the office of a small company, or a small home office with few devices.
>       -   Doesn't have to be an actual home ‘office’, if your home has a network connected to the Internet it is considered a SOHO network.
>   -   SOHO networks don’t have complex needs, so all networking functions are typically provided by a single device, often called a ‘**home router**’ or ‘**wireless router**’. 
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202305142238162.png" alt="image-20230514223812003" style="zoom:38%;" />
>
>   -   There is no need for a dedicated device for each function. This one device can serve as a:
>       -   router: connecting the home network to the Internet;
>       -   switch: there are usually a few switchports on the back to connect other devices to;
>       -   firewall: typically configured to block all connections coming from the outside network, but to allow connections to the Internet from internal devices.
>       -   Wireless Access Point: allowing you to connect your laptop or phone, for example, to the network using WiFi.
>       -   Also in some cases it can also serve as a **Modem for cable internet**, although sometimes the modem is a separate device.
>

## Lab - STP & HSRP Synchronization

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202305142301411.png" alt="image-20230514230155344" style="zoom:100%;" />

>   Basically, HSRP and STP synchronization means that the HSRP active should be the STP root bridge, and the HSRP standby should be the STP secondary root bridge. 
>
>   ###### Why should the HSRP active and the STP root be synchronized or aligned?
>
>   -   It’s to ensure that traffic from the end hosts follows the most direct path to the default gateway.
>   -   If the HSRP active router isn’t the STP root, then traffic from PC1 to DSW1 might not take the direct path to DSW1, it might take a longer path via DSW2.

In this lab, we’ll make DSW1 the HSRP active and STP root for VLAN 10, and make DSW2 the HSRP active and STP root for VLAN 20.

###### Before configuring HSRP and STP, let’s check the current state on DSW1.

```sh
