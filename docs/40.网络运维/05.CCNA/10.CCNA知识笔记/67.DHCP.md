# DHCP

>   ##### Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, 动态主机配置协议
>
>   DHCP is used to allow hosts to automatically/dynamically learn various aspects of their network configuration(such as IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, DNS server, etc) without manual/static configuration.
>
>   -   使用**UDP**协议, Server端使用**67端口**, Client使用**68端口**;
>   -   在Cisco路由器上 DHCP服务 是默认开启的, `service dhcp` in the Globally-Config mode;
>
>   ```sh
>   R2(config)#service ?
>     dhcp                 Enable DHCP server and relay agent
>     nagle                Enable Nagle's congestion control algorithm
>     password-encryption  Encrypt system passwords
>     timestamps           Timestamp debug/log messages
>   ```
>
>   -   通常被应用在局域网中，主要作用是集中地管理、分配IP地址，使网络环境中的主机可以动态的获得IP地址、Gateway地址、DNS服务器地址等网络配置。
>   -   DHCP协议采用client/server模式。当[DHCP服务器](https://baike.baidu.com/item/DHCP服务器/9956953)接收到来自网络主机申请地址的信息时，才会向网络主机发送相关的地址配置等信息，以实现网络主机地址信息的动态配置.
>   -   Typically used for ‘client devices’ such as workstations (PCs), IP phones, etc.

>   >
>   >       -   It means that this PC was previously assigned this IP address by the DHCP server.
>   >
>   >       -   Then, when it asked the server for an IP address again, it asked to receive the same address again.
>   >
>   >   -   **Lease Time**: DHCP servers ‘lease’ IP addresses to clients. 
>   >
>   >       -   These leases are *usually* not permanent, and the client must give up the IP address at the end of the lease. 
>   >
>   >       -   A client can also release the address before the lease is up, if it no longer needs it.
>   >
>   >       -   It is possible to configure the DHCP server to permanently assign IP addresses. However, it’s almost always best to set a lease time. 
>   >
>   >           (If the IP address leases were permanent, every time a new customer comes into the cafe and connects to the WiFi, the customer’s devices would be permanently assigned IP addresses, unless the client device releases it.)
>
>   -   Devices such as routers, servers, etc, are usually manually configured. 
>   -   In small networks (Such as home networks) the router typically acts as the DHCP server for hosts in the LAN.
>   -   In larger networks, the DHCP server is usually a Windows/Linux server.

## Demostration

demonstrate the process that a DHCP client goes through to get an IP address from a DHCP server

##### 1. first I need to make my PC release its IP address, so it can ask the server again.

The command in the Windows command prompt to release the DHCP-learned IP address is `ipconfig /release`

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304241140873.png" alt="image-20230424113844513" style="zoom:43%;" />

The process to release the DHCP-learned IP be like:

Used Wireshark to capture that DHCP release message:

>   -   For the CCNA you should focus on learning the four message process used to lease an IP address from a DHCP server, which will be talked later.
>   -   Of course, the message is an **Ethernet frame** so here’s the Ethernet header.
>   -   *An IPv4 header is inside*, from source IP address `192.168.0.167`(the PC), to destination IP `192.168.0.1`(the router)
>   -   *Inside is a UDP header*, and notice the ports. **Source port 68, destination port 67.**
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304241148467.png" alt="image-20230424114841377" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   >   This is different than DNS, for example, in which only the port of the server is specified, and the client uses a random ephemeral port. 
>
>   -   Finally, inside of the UDP segment we have the DHCP release message. 
>
>       -   Magic Cookie
>
>           >   Now, as to the history and purpose of the Magic Cookie: DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol - RFC 2131) is based on the prior BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol - RFC 951) and supports the BOOTP Vendor Information Extensions (RFC 1497). RFC 951 loosely defined a variable length vendor specific field (vend) specifies that the first four octets should contain a 4 byte magic number. To quote from RFC 951:
>           >
>           >   >   If the 'vend' field is used, it is recommended that a 4 byte 'magic number' be the first item within 'vend'. This lets a server determine what kind of information it is seeing in this field. Numbers can be assigned by the usual 'magic number' process --you pick one and it's magic.
>           >
>           >   Going forward to RFC 1497 which further defined and fixed a format for the BOOTP Vendor Information Extensions variable length field, this RFC defined the first four octets to be a “Magic Cookie” with the hex value of 63.82.53.63 (decimal 99.130.83.99). This value indicates to the DHCP (or BOOTP) server that the format of the variable length Vendor Information Extensions is as defined by RFC 1497.
>           >
>           >   Now, the current DHCP RFC 2131 states that the Vendor Information Extensions defined in RFC 1497 are included in DHCP and reiterates that the above value of the “Magic Cookie” is to be used.
>
>       -   The client IP is indicated here.
>
>       -   And notice these ‘options’ down here. DHCP has various options used for different purposes:
>
>           -   For example option 53, at the top, indicates what kind of DHCP message it is.

##### Get an IP address from DHCP server (again):

From the Windows command prompt I used the command `ipconfig /renew`:

>   ##### This process involves four messages:
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304241349484.png" alt="image-20230424134945321" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   ###### **DHCP Discover** message: 
>
>   It is a broadcast(Layer-3 & Layer-2) message from the client.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304241201907.png" alt="image-20230424120135715" style="zoom:40%;" />
>
>   -   **Bootp flags** field:
>       -   Bootp is actually the predecessor of DHCP. The value of ‘**unicast**’ here, represented by `0x0000`. This may seem odd, the message is broadcast but this field says unicast. Actually it's telling the server to send its messages using unicast,
>   -   **Options**: 
>       -   *Requested IP Address*: Because my PC previously had the IP address 192.168.0.167, it requested that address again. 
>           -   If the address is available, the server might grant it that same IP address again. 
>           -   But if it’s not, my PC would get a different IP address.
>           -   If this is the first time my PC is using DHCP, it won’t request an IP address like this, it will simply leave it up to the server to decide.
>
>   ###### **DHCP Offer** message:
>
>   ![image-20230424133818180](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304241338443.png)
>
>   -   notice the Offer is sent as a **unicast frame** to the client’s MAC address, since the server learned the client’s MAC address from the Discover message.
>
>   -   It’s also **unicast at Layer 3**, the destination is the IP address being offered to the client.
>
>   -   This time the source and destination port number are reversed, since it’s a message from the server to the client. The source is UDP 67 and the destination is UDP 68.
>
>   -   And here’s the Offer message. Let’s look at the fields:
>
>       -    ‘**Bootp flags**’: it says unicast. However, that’s not always the case. The DHCP Offer message can be sent to the client using either **broadcast** or **unicast**. It depends on the client. 
>
>           >   When my PC sent the DHCP Discover message this field was also set to 0000, unicast. This means that the server will send its messages using unicast, as I just showed you above. 
>           >
>           >   -   In this case my PC told the router to send the Offer using unicast, so it did. 
>           >
>           >       At this point in the DHCP process, the client’s IP address isn’t actually configured. Some clients won’t accept unicast messages before their IP address is actually configured, so that’s why sometimes broadcast must be used instead of unicast.
>           >
>           >   -   If my PC told the router to send the Offer using broadcast, the destination MAC of this message would be all `F`’s and the destination IP would be `255.255.255.255`.
>
>       -   **option 51** indicates the lease time, 
>
>       -   **option 6** is ‘domain name server’ that’s the DNS server,
>
>       -   **option 3** is ‘router’, which tells the client the default gateway.
>
>   ###### **DHCP Request** message
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304241345107.png" alt="image-20230424134501854" style="zoom:50%;" />
>
>   It is sent from the DHCP client to the server, telling the server that it wants to use the IP address it was offered. This is important, there may be multiple DHCP servers on the local network, and all of them will reply to the client’s Discover message with an Offer. So, the client has to tell which server it is accepting the offer from and request to use that IP address. Typically, the client will accept the first Offer it receives.
>
>   -   This is a broadcast message. If there are multiple DHCP servers on the network, all of them will receive this message. One of the later fields will indicate which server the PC accepted the offer from.
>   -   The source IP is still 0.0.0.0, since the offered IP address hasn’t actually been configured yet.
>   -   The destination is broadcast, 255.255.255.255. Since it’s a message from the client to the server, the source port is UDP 68 and the destination is UDP 67.
>   -   And here’s the request massage:
>       -   **Bootp** flags: telling the server to send its messages using unicast, even though the client itself uses broadcast.
>       -   Notice that the server’s IP address is indicated using **option 54**. If there are multiple DHCP servers on the local network, this is how the client says which server it selected.
>
>   ###### **DHCP Ack** message
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304241348476.png" alt="image-20230424134832226" style="zoom:50%;" />
>
>   This is sent from the server to the client, confirming that the client may use the requested IP address. Once this message is received the client, finally configures the IP address on its network interface.
>
>   -   Notice this is unicast;
>   -   here’s the Ack message: 
>       -   The Bootp flags field once again indicates unicast, because the client requested unicast messages.

## DHCP Relay

>   -   Some network engineers might choose to configure each router to act as the DHCP server for its connected LANs. 
>   -   However, large enterprises often choose to use a *centralized DHCP server*, which will assign IP addresses to DHCP clients in all subnets throughout the enterprise network.
>       -   If the server is centralized, it won’t receive the DHCP clients’ broadcast DHCP messages.
>       -   Remember, broadcast messages don’t leave the local subnet, routers don’t forward them. 
>   -   To fix this, you can configure a router to act as a ‘**DHCP relay agent**’. If you do that, the *router will forward the clients’ broadcast DHCP messages to the remote DHCP server* as **unicast messages**. 

### Quick overview of how DHCP relay agents work

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304241355535.png" alt="image-20230424135529444" style="zoom:33%;" />

>   PC1 is a DHCP client, so it will broadcast a DHCP Discover message to ask DHCP servers on the local network to assign it an IP address. However, in this case R1 isn’t a DHCP server. SRV1 is the central DHCP server for this network, so R1 will need to forward any DHCP messages from PC1 to SRV1.

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304241401509.png" alt="image-20230424140153299" style="zoom:33%;" />

>   1.   PC1 broadcasts a DHCP Discover message to get an IP address. 
>   2.   R1, a DHCP relay agent, relays the message to SRV1. Notice that the source address changes to the address of R1’s G0/1 interface, and the destination is SRV1’s IP address. **So, it is a unicast message**.
>   3.   Then SRV1 replies with the DHCP Offer, sending it to the address of R1’s G0/1 interface, `192.168.1.1`. R1 then forwards it to PC1. The source is R1’s IP address, and the message is either sent unicast to PC1 or broadcast. 
>   4.   Then PC1 broadcasts a request message, and R1 relays it to SRV1. 
>   5.   Finally SRV1 replies with a DHCP Ack, and R1 forwards that to PC1, which configures the IP address it was assigned, for example 192.168.1.100.

## Configurations

### Configure a Cisco router as a *DHCP server*

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304241418746.png" alt="image-20230424141824657" style="zoom:43%;" />

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304241419909.png" alt="image-20230424141904637" style="zoom:38%;" />

>   ```sh
>   Router(config)# ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.10
>   ```
>
>   -   These are addresses you want to reserve, perhaps for network devices or servers in the local subnet. 
>   -   The first address in the command is the low end of the range, and then the second is the top of the range. So, this reserves all addresses from `192.168.1.1` through `192.168.1.10`.
>   -   This command isn’t necessary, but it’s a good idea to reserve some addresses which can be statically assigned to servers, network devices, or whatever. 
>
>   ```sh
>   Router(config)# ip dhcp pool Pool_Name
>   ```
>
>   -   DHCP pool? It’s basically a subnet of addresses that can be assigned to DHCP clients, as well as other info such as DNS server and default gateway.
>   -   You should create a separate DHCP pool for each network the router is acting as a DHCP server for. In this case R1 is only acting as the DHCP server for 192.168.1.0/24, so I only need to create one pool. 
>
>   ```sh
>   Router(dhcp-config)# network Network_Address Network_mask
>   ```
>
>   -   configure the range of addresses to be assigned to clients, But excludes the addresses I reserved above.
>   -   you can write `/24` or `255.255.255.0`, either works. 
>
>   ```sh
>   Router(dhcp-config)# dns-server 8.8.8.8
>   ```
>
>   -   configure the DNS server that clients in the network should use.
>   -   in this case R1 would tell PC1 to use Google’s DNS server at `8.8.8.8` for its DNS queries.
>
>   ```sh
>   Router(dhcp-config)# domain-name Domain_Name
>   ```
>
>   -   You can also configure the domain name of the network. In this case R1 will tell PC1 that it is part of the domain ‘jeremysitlab.com’.
>
>   ```sh
>   Router(dhcp-config)# default-router Default_Gateway
>   ```
>
>   -   configure the default gateway for the DHCP clients. So, R1 will tell clients to use its address, 192.168.1.1, as their default gateway.
>
>   ```sh
>   Router(dhcp-config)# lease { Days Hours Minutes | infinite }
>   ```
>
>   You can also configure the lease time. `lease infinite` is not recommended!

# this command will add a defualt route on the router which is DHCP client, will be shown later.
# it functions like the defualt-information originate in the router-config mode when configuring dynamic routing protocols
R2(dhcp-config)#exit
```

Configure R1 as DHCP client to get an DHCP-learned IP:

```sh
R1(config)#int g0/0
R1(config-if)#do sh ip int g0/0
GigabitEthernet0/0 is administratively down, line protocol is down (disabled)
  Internet protocol processing disabled

R1(config-if)#no shutdown 

R1(config-if)#
%LINK-5-CHANGED: Interface GigabitEthernet0/0, changed state to up

%LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface GigabitEthernet0/0, changed state to up

R1(config-if)#ip address ?
  A.B.C.D  IP address
  dhcp     IP Address negotiated via DHCP
R1(config-if)#ip address dhcp 
R1(config-if)#
%DHCP-6-ADDRESS_ASSIGN: Interface GigabitEthernet0/0 assigned DHCP address 203.0.113.2, mask 255.255.255.252, hostname R1
```

Configure R1 as DHCP Relay Agent:

```sh
R1(config)#int g0/1
R1(config-if)#ip helper-address 203.0.113.1
```

Check 

```sh
R1(config-if)#
R1(config-if)#do sh ip route
