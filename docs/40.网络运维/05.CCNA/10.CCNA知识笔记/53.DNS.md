# Domain Name System

## Introduction to DNS

>   -   DNS is used to resolve easy-to-remember names(such as google.com) to IP addresses.
>   -   Network devices such as PCs don’t use names, they use addresses(IPv4 and IPv6 addresses); However, names are much easier for us humans to use and remember than IP addresses.
>   -   When you type ‘*youtube.com*’ into a web browser, your device will ask a DNS server for the IP address of *youtube.com*.
>   -   The DNS server(s), your device uses can be *manually configured* or *learned via DHCP*.

### Demonstration

>   Now I’ll use this network to demonstrate how it works.
>
>   -   Three PCs are connected to R1 via SW1.
>   -   R1 is connected to the Internet, and somewhere across the Internet is Google’s DNS server with the IP address `8.8.8.8`.
>
>   So, let’s go on to PC1, a Windows PC, and check out how DNS works.
>
>   -   Use the command `ipconfig /all` on Windows to check the IP configurations:
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304231304199.png" alt="image-20230423130435069" style="zoom:38%;" />
>
>   -   Use the command `nslookup FQDN_Name` to make the device to ask its DNS server for the IP address of the specified name: (`nslookup` stands for *name server lookup*);
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304231315846.png" alt="image-20230423131546784" style="zoom:36%;" />

### Use Wireshark to capture the traffic from that NSLOOKUP command.

>
>   -   There are four messages(*two for IPv4, two for IPv6*):
>
>       1.   **standard DNS query** request message: It’s from source 192.168.0.101, PC1, to destination 8.8.8.8, Google’s DNS server;
>            -   Notice this part here, ‘**A youtube.com**’: *DNS ‘A’ records are used to map names to IPv4 addresses.*
>
>       2.   **standard DNS query response** message: from Google’s DNS server 8.8.8.8 to PC1, 192.168.0.101.
>       3.   **standard DNS query** request message: It’s from source 192.168.0.101, PC1, to destination 8.8.8.8, Google’s DNS server;
>            -   Notice this part here, ‘**AAAA youtube.com**’: *DNS ‘quadruple A’ records are used to map names to IPv6 addresses.*
>
>       4.   **standard DNS query response** message: from Google’s DNS server 8.8.8.8 to PC1, 192.168.0.101.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304231329149.png" alt="image-20230423132921001" style="zoom:38%;" />
>
>   -   Remember, DNS uses both TCP and UDP, so why is UDP used here?
>
>       -   **Standard DNS queries and responses typically use UDP.**
>       -   **TCP is used for DNS messages greater than 512 bytes.**
>       -   In either case, UDP or TCP, the port number is 53.
>
>       >   ###### If you’d like to know the details, try a google search for ‘DNS TCP UDP’
>       >
>       >   UDP packets are smaller in size. UDP packets can't be greater than 512 bytes. So any application needs data to be transferred greater than 512 bytes require TCP in place. For example, DNS uses both TCP and UDP for valid reasons described below. UDP messages aren't larger than 512 Bytes and are truncated when greater than this size. DNS uses TCP for Zone transfer and UDP for name, and queries either regular (primary) or reverse. UDP can be used to exchange small information whereas TCP must be used to exchange information larger than 512 bytes. If a client doesn't get response from DNS, it must retransmit the data using TCP after 3-5 seconds of interval.
>       >
>       >   There should be consistency in DNS Zone database. To make this, DNS always transfers Zone data using TCP because TCP is reliable and make sure zone data is consistent by transferring the full zone to other DNS servers who has requested the data.

### DNS Cache

>   -   Devices will save the DNS server’s responses to a local DNS cache.
>   -   This means they don’t have to query the server every single time they want to access a particular destination.

>   To view the DNS cache on a Windows PC use the command `ipconfig /displaydns`.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304231337167.png" alt="image-20230423133716066" style="zoom:39%;" />
>
>   >   look at the record type: 
>   >
>   >   -   It’s not *A or quadruple A*, it’s **CNAME**, and it lists another domain name.
>   >   -   CNAME, canonical name, is another kind of DNS record that basically maps a name to another name.

>   In the Windows command prompt, you can *clear the DNS cache* with the command `ipconfig /flushdns`
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304231342687.png" alt="image-20230423134207616" style="zoom:43%;" />

### hosts file on most devices

>   In addition to a DNS cache, most devices have a ‘hosts’ file which is simply a list of hosts and IP addresses. 
>
>   -   This isn’t DNS, but it’s a simple alternative to DNS. A long time ago before DNS was invented, host files like this were used. 
>   -   In modern days, a hosts file might be used in a small network to list some hosts on the local network if necessary. However, **DNS is a much better solution**.

>   In Windows, it’s in the `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc` folder, and the file is ‘`hosts`’.

### `Ping FQDN_Name`

>   -   Use the command `ping FQDN_Name:` will call the DNS automatically;
>       1.  To learn the IP address of youtube.com, PC1 sends a DNS query message to its configured DNS server, `8.8.8.8`;
>       2.  Then the DNS server replies, telling PC1 that the IP address is `172.217.25.110`;
>

>
>   >   -   In this case, R1 isn’t acting as a DNS server or client. It is simply forwarding packets. 
>   >   -   Often there’s simply no need to do any DNS configuration on routers. They just need to perform their job of routing network traffic.
>   >   -   However, a Cisco router can act as a DNS server and client, so I’ll show you how to configure that later in this video.

## Configure DNS in Cisco IOS

### Configuration

#### Configure Router as DNS Server

Now let’s look at how to configure DNS in Cisco IOS, **using R1 as the DNS server for PCs**.

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304231353703.png" alt="image-20230423135306596" style="zoom:33%;" />

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304231413903.png" alt="image-20230423141355694" style="zoom:33%;" />

>   **Let me repeat:**
>
>   -   For hosts in a network to use DNS on the Internet, you don’t need to configure DNS on the routers. They will simply forward the DNS messages like any other packets.
>   -   However, the Cisco router itself can be configured as a DNS server, although it’s **rare**.
>       -   If a DNS server in the local network is used, usually it’s a *Windows or Linux server*.

>   ##### Check the host mapping config and DNS cache on Routers:
>
>   To view both the configured hosts, as well as the hosts learned and cached via DNS, use the command `show hosts` in the Priviledged-EXEC mode.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304231431155.png" alt="image-20230423143152975" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   -   Notice in the ‘flags’ column:
>       -   ‘temp’, for temporary;
>       -   'perm', for permanent;

#### enable router as DNS Client

>   A Cisco router can be configured as a **DNS client**, so you can execute `ping` and other commands using names instead of IP addresses.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304231440487.png" alt="image-20230423144047307" style="zoom:38%;" />

#### Configure Domain name on Router

>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304231450043.png" alt="image-20230423145027889" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   Now there is one more optional command that you can use,  which is `ip domain name Name`.
>
>   -   Names like ‘google.com’ and ‘jeremysitlab.com’ are domain names, and they define a realm or area of administrative control in the Internet.
>       -   For example, the domain name ‘google.com’ tells us that Gmail at ‘mail.google.com’, DNS server ’dns.google.com’, Google’s NTP servers at ‘time.google.com’, all fall under Google’s administration and control.
>
>   -   When this command is applied, this will be a default domain name applied to all hostnames without a specified domain name.
>       -   For example, the command `ping pc1` will actually become `ping pc1.jeremysitlab.com`.

### Demostrations

#### Demo_1

So let’s say PC1 wants to ping PC2.

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304231417378.png" alt="image-20230423141708187" style="zoom:33%;" />

>   Note that I used ‘-n 1’ to send only a single ping, for the purpose of this demonstration.

>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304231423042.png" alt="image-20230423142313920" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   1.   PC1 doesn’t have an entry for PC2 in its own host table, so it has to use DNS to learn the IP address of PC2;
>   2.   It sends a query to its DNS server R1, asking ‘What’s the IP address of PC2?’;
>   3.   R1 has an entry for PC2, I just configured it in the last slide using the `ip host` command, so it replies to PC1’s query.
>   4.   Finally PC1 sends the ping to PC2, PC2 sends a reply, and the process is over.
>
>   Now PC1 has entry for PC2 in its **DNS cache**, so if I issue the PING PC2 command again, it won’t have to perform a DNS query, it already knows PC2’s IP address.

#### Demo_2

This time, I issued the command `ping youtube.com -n 1`.

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304231427826.png" alt="image-20230423142741595" style="zoom:33%;" />

>   1.   Before PC1 can actually send the ping, it has to know the IP address of `youtube.com`. There is no such entry in the host file on itself, so it sends a query to its DNS server, R1.
>   2.   R1 acts as a DNS server for PCs, but if it doesn’t have an entry for a record that PCs' requests, it acts as a DNS client and asks Google’s DNS server for the record. Remember I used the `ip name-server 8.8.8.8` command on R1, so R1 can send queries to Google’s DNS server(`8.8.8.8`).
>   3.   Google’s server replies, telling R1 the IP address of youtube.com. R1 store the entry in its DNS cache.
>   4.   Now R1 replies to PC1’s query, telling it the IP address of youtube.com. Also, PC1 store the entry in its DNS cache.
>   5.   Finally PC1 is able to send the ping to YouTube, and YouTube sends the reply.

        <li>This router simply forwards traffic between the devices, but HostA is not trying to access something on this router so there's no need to establish a TCP connection.</li>
        <li>HostA has to contact the DNS server to learn the IP address of the web server. But standard DNS queries and responses use UDP, not TCP. So there's no need to establish a TCP connection with this DNS server.</li>
        <li>HTTP uses TCP port 80, so HostA must establish a TCP connection with the web server.</li>
