# Accessing the CLI of network devices

## Console Port Security

>   -   The console line is where you configure all settings related to console port connections.
>   -   By default, no password is needed to access the CLI of a Cisco IOS device via the console port.
>   -   However, you can configure a password on the console line. When you do this, a user will have to enter a password to access the CLI via the console port.  

>   ##### login
>
>   To configure the console line, use the command `line console 0` from global config mode.
>
>   -   There is only a single console line, so the number is always 0. 
>       -   *It means there can only be a single console connection at once.*
>       -   You can’t have multiple people configuring the device at the same time via separate console ports.

>
>   ##### login local
>
>   Alternatively, you can configure the console line to require users to login using one of the configured **usernames** on the device. After the configuration, instead of logging in using the password configured on the console line, the user **will have to** use a username and password.

>
>   -   By the way, here’s the current configuration of R1’s console line. 
>       -   Notice that the password of `ccna `that I configured previously is still there, however I changed the login mode from `LOGIN `to `LOGIN LOCAL`, so the console line’s password of `ccna `can no longer be used. **The user must login using an account on the device.**
>
>   ##### `exec-timeout`
>
>   `exec-timeout 3 30` This command will cause the device to log the user out after a certain period of inactivity, 3 minutes and 30 seconds in this case. This is a good security practice, in case you leave your desk but forget to log out of the console connection.

## Layer 2 Switch Management IP

>   -   Routers and Layer 3 switches have IP addresses you can use to connect remotely to manage the devices;
>   -   But what about Layer 2 switches? 
>       -   Layer 2 switches don’t perform packet routing and don’t build a routing table. They aren’t IP routing aware. Their purpose is simply to forward frames in the LAN, as you already know.
>       -   However, you can actually assign an IP address to an SVI(Switch Virtual Interface) to allow remote connections to the CLI of the switch(using Telnet or SSH).

For the rest of this video, I’ll use this network topology.

The network admin is using PC2, and needs to be able to connect to all of the devices in the network to configure them, without having to travel to different offices.

1.   To allow this, the layer 2 switches need an IP address. Configure the IP address on the SVI in the same way as on a multilayer switch. `interface vlan Vlan_ID`. Then configure the IP address.
2.   Enable the interface if its shutdown by default. So, the SVI is configured.
3.   However there’s one more step you need to configure to allow a Layer 2 switch to communicate with devices outside of its local LAN. Use the `ip defualt-gateway IP_Address` command to configure the default gateway of the switch.



## Telnet

>   -   It’s not commonly used today due to a lack of security, but it’s good to know before looking at SSH.
>   -   Telnet(Teletype network) is a protocol used to remotely access the CLI of a remote host. So instead of plugging your PC directly into the device with a console cable, you can connect to the device on a remote network.
>   -   Telnet was developed in 1969. However SSH was developed in 1995, so Telnet had many years of use.
>   -   *It has been largely, almost entirely, replaced by SSH, which is more secure.* 
>   -   **Telnet sends data in plain text, no encryption.** So if someone uses a tool like Wireshark to capture the traffic, they can read exactly what was sent.  
>       -   Demonstration for example: 
>           -   Up top is a *Telnet packet sent from R1*, inside it says ‘password’. This is the password prompt the CLI displays when trying to login. 
>               -   I entered the password, and it was sent in a packet to R1. But the password is displayed in plain text, `ccnp`, no encryption. 
>           -   So, anyone in the middle who is able to capture the traffic like I did here will be able to read all of the traffic between my device and R1. The username, the password, and all of the traffic after that.

##### Check the remote access

>   Notice how the VTY line configurations are displayed in the running config of the device.
>
>   -   The first 5 VTY lines are displayed above, and the remaining 11 are below.
>   -   this is just a result of the fact that old versions of IOS only had 5 VTY lines. So, even if you configure all 16 lines at once, they display separately in the config. 
>   -   That’s just a bit of trivia, it doesn’t have any effect on the operation of the lines.

## SSH

>   -   SSH, which stands for **Secure Shell**, was developed in 1995 to replace less secure protocols like Telnet.
>

>
>   -   SSHv2, a major revision of SSHv1, was released in 2006. Version 2 is more secure, so it should be used whenever possible. 
>   -   If a device supports both version 1 and version 2, it is said to run **version 1.99**. 
>       -   Note that 1.99 isn’t actually a version of SSH, it just means that the device supports both version 1 and version 2.
>   -   SSH provides security features such as **data encryption** and **authentication**.
>       -   for example, here’s an SSH packet that I captured in Wireshark. 
>           -   Looking at the encrypted packet section, it’s just a seemingly random string of characters.
>           -   Only the SSH server and client have the keys to decrypt this packet, so even though I captured the packet on the way to its destination, I don’t know what the contents are.

>
>   -   SSH uses TCP port 22.

### Configure SSH Server on Switch/Router

##### Ensure the IOS image supports SSH

Before configuring SSH, you should make sure that the version of IOS on your device supports it.

>   -   IOS images that *support SSH* will have **K9** in their name. 
>   -   Cisco exports NPE(No Payload Encryption) IOS images to countries that have restrictions on encryption technologies. And those NPE IOS images do not support cryptographic features like SSH. 
>   -   **RSA keys** are cryptographic keys that are essential for the various security features of SSH.

##### Configure the hostname

>   -   The device cannot generate its RSA keys without a non-default hostname.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304252023719.png" alt="image-20230425202308597" style="zoom:39%;" />

##### Generate RSA Keys

>   -   To enable and use SSH, you must generate an *RSA public and private key pair*.
>   -   The keys are used for **data encryption/decryption**, **authentication**, etc.

>   -   FQDN means Fully Qualified Domain Name, which is the host name plus the DNS domain name. The reason for this is that the FQDN of the device is used to name the RSA keys.

##### Configure SSH on VTY Lines

>   -   Note that you can’t use `login` for SSH, , only `login local` works, a username is needed.
>   -   You can also authenticate to an authentication server, but that’s a topic for another video.
>
>   ```sh
>   SW2(config-line)#login ?
>     authentication  authenticate using aaa method list
>     local           Local password checking
>     <cr>
>   ```
