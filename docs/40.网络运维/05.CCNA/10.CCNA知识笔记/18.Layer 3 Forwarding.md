# Layer 3 Forwarding

## Bitwise XOR and AND operations

>   How does a **network host** (*ie. your PC*) determine if a packet should be forwarded to the default gateway, or if it can be forwarded directly to the destination host?
>
>   -   Source and Destination in same subnet = **forward directly** 
>   -   Source and Destination in different subnets = **forward to default gateway**

>   For a host to determine if the destination is in the same subnet or not, two ‘**bitwise**’ operations are used: 
>
>   -   (*A ‘Bitwise Operation’ operates on a number (ie. an IP address) at the level of its individual bits.*);
>   -   **The XOR operation** is used to identify which bits are different between two addresses. 
>   -   The subnet mask identifies the network portion of the address. If any bits of the network portion are different, the two addresses are in different subnets. -> **The AND operation is used to determine if this is the case.**
>
>   ##### Process in details:
>
>   -   **XOR**(which stands for exclusive OR): used to compare the bits of the **source IP and the destination IP**. If two bits are the same, the result is 0. 
>       -   If two bits are different, the result is 1. 
>       -   After the XOR operation, an AND operation is performed.

>
>   -   **AND**: AND compares bits of two numbers and will give a result of 1 if both bits are 1. If either or both of the bits are 0, the result will be 0.

>
>   -   **If the AND result is all Os, it means the source and destination are in the same subnet. The source host can send the packet directly to the destination host.**
>   -   **If there are any 1s in the AND result, the hosts are in different subnets and the source host must send the packet to its default gateway.**

## Layer 3 Forwarding within a LAN

>   When a host sending a packet has identified that the destination host is in the same subnet **by using the XOR and AND operations**, it can **send the packet directly to the destination host**.
>
>   -   There is no need to send the packet to a router for routing. Because routers route packets between networks, not within the same network.
>   -   So, the packet will be encapsulated in an Ethernet frame, and *the destination MAC address* will be the **destination host’s MAC address**.
>       -   The sending host will check its **ARP cache** for an entry matching the destination IP. 
>       -   *If there is no entry, it will send an ARP request.*

## Layer 3 Forwarding between networks (Routing)

>   When the XOR/AND indicates that the destination is in another network, the source host will send the packet to its **default gateway**.
>
>   -   When the router receives the frame/packet, it will change the **destination MAC address** to that of **the next-hop router OR the destination host**, and **the source MAC address** to **that of its sending interface**.
>       -   It will also **decrement the IP TTL**, **recalculate the IP header checksum**, and **recalculate the Ethernet FCS**.

## Forwarding decisions (Routing table)

>   ##### Layer 2 vs Layer 3 Forwarding Decisions:
>
>   -   Layer 2 forwarding decisions involve looking for an **exact match in the MAC address table**.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202306070034571.png" alt="image-20230607003440502" style="zoom:70%;" />
>
>   -   Layer 3 forwarding decisions involve looking for **the most specific match in the routing table**. When it comes to making a Layer 3 forwarding decision, **the matching route with the longest prefix length** wins.

>   ##### What about Administrative Distance and Metric?
>
>   -   They are used to determine **which routes are added to the routing table**. 
>
>   -   After routes are in the routing table, a router will use **the most specific matching route** rule to make forwarding decisions.

## Configuring IPv4 Addresses

>   -   Something similar to this before in the CCNA when configuring router-on-a-stick, In that case, you divided the physical interface into **multiple logical sub-interfaces**, and assigned a unique IP address and VLAN to each sub-interface.
>   -   When configuring secondary IP addresses on an interface like this, it is a single physical and logical interface, but with multiple IP addresses. 
>   -   There are a few use cases for this, for example if you are migrating from one subnet to another. 
>   -   You can use secondary IP addresses to temporarily allow the router to support both the old and new subnets, and then remove the old IP address and subnet after all end hosts have been moved to the new subnet. 
>   -   There are other use cases too, but the exact use cases are not really relevant to ENCOR. 



## Verifying IPv4 Addresses

## Directed Broadcasts

### Intro to Directed Broadcast

>   -   A directed broadcast message is a message sent to the broadcast address of another subnet (not the subnet of the sending host). 
>       -   When a device wants to send a broadcast to its own subnet, it will use the 255.255.255.255 broadcast address. 
>   -   **Routers in the path** will forward these directed broadcast packets as normal packets. 
>       - They don't know that the message is destined for a broadcast address, because the IP header only includes a destination IP address, not a destination subnet mask. To them, the packet looks like a unicast packet. 
>
>   -   When **the router connected to the destination subnet** receives the message, it will know that the destination is a broadcast address (because it knows the destination network). By default, the **Router connected to the destination subnet** will drop *the directed broadcast message*, and reply out of the interface that received the message.
>   -   Forwarding of directed broadcast messages can be enable with the following command (on the interface the message will be broadcast out of): `R1(contig-if)# ip directed-broadcast`

>   ##### Connect to R1’s console port and View debugging messages at Syslog severity level 7.:

>   ###### Start debug mode:

>
>   ###### ping the Interface IP of R4

>
>   ###### Ping the broadcast IP address of R4's subnet:
>
>   Routers don’t forward directed broadcasts by default so R3 should have dropped it.
>
>   -   R3 is directly connected to the subnet `192.168.34.0/24`, it decided to reply to the ping itself.
>   -   Note that it doesn’t use its 192.168.34.3 IP address as the source IP of the reply though. 
>   -   Instead it uses the 192.168.23.3 IP address of G0/0, the interface it uses to send the reply, as the source.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202306080752219.png" alt="image-20230608075243138" style="zoom:67%;" />
>
>   ###### After enable directed broadcasts on R3:
>
>   -   Remember, you should enable it on the interface the message will be broadcast out of, and that is R3’s G0/1, connected to the 192.168.34.0/24 subnet.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202306080757541.png" alt="image-20230608075739431" style="zoom:67%;" />
>
>   -   All the configured IP in the subnet will reply to the Directed Broadcast. Just like R3's G0/1 and R4's G0/0, if other hosts were connected to the segment, they would respond too.

### Summary

>   -   Directed broadcasts are probably not used much these days, which explains why the `ip directed broacast` command is disabled by default.
>   -   Directed broadcast might be used by some old applications that rely on broadcast like this.
>   -   Before wrapping up(结束), let me clarify that this directed broadcast message is only actually broadcast when it reaches the destination network.
>       -   When R1 forwards it to R2, the destination MAC is unicast, the MAC of R2’s G0/1 interface.
>       -   When R2 forwards it to R3, the destination MAC is also unicast, that of R3’s G0/0.
>       -   And then finally it is broadcast to the all F’s MAC address when R3 sends it out of G0/1.
>       -   In this case there is only one other device to receive the broadcast, R4, but if there were others they would reply as well.
