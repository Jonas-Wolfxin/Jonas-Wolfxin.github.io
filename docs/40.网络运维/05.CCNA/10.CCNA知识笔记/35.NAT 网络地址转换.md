# Network Address Translation

>   -   IPv4 doesn’t provide enough addresses for all devices that need an IP address in the modern world. 
>   -   The long-term solution is to switch to IPv6, but changing networks all over the world from IPv4 to IPv6 is no simple task.
>   -   So, before we switch completely over to IPv6, there are three main short-term solutions to this problem, which have actually extended the lifespan of IPv4:
>       -   **CIDR(Classless Inter-Domain Routing)**: With CIDR we can forget about the rigid IPv4 address classes and are free to use any prefix length with any address, no need to think about classes.
>       -   **Private IPv4 addresses**
>       -   **NAT**.
>
>   ##### Private IPv4 Addresses(RFC 1918)
>
>   -   **RFC 1918** specifies the following Three *private IPv4 address ranges* respectively from:
>
>       -   Class A: `10.0.0.0/8`, which includes `10.0.0.0` to `10.255.255.255`; 
>       -   Class B: `172.16.0.0/12`, which includes `172.16.0.0` to `172.31.255.255`;
>       -   Class C: `192.168.0.0/16`, which includes `192.168.0.0` to `192.168.255.255`.
>
>       >   In any case, don’t be too attached to the concept of address classes. In modern networks everyone uses CIDR, so address classes are a thing of the past.
>
>   -   **Private IP addresses cannot be used over the Internet.** ISP(Internet Service Provider) will drop traffic to or from private IP addresses.
>
>   -   You may be wondering, if the private IP addresses can’t be used over the Internet, how can I access the Internet from my PC? That’s where NAT comes in.

>   ##### Demonstration of NAT
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304261749354.png" alt="image-20230426174958232" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   -   Without NAT, there are two big problems here.:
>       -   The first is that **there are duplicate addresses**. If there is a packet traveling over the Internet with the destination address `192.168.0.167`, which PC will it go to? My PC? Or the other one with the same IP address?
>       -   Another problem is that **private IP addresses can’t even be used over the Internet**, so the PCs can’t access the Internet.
>   -   However, **NAT solves both of these problems.**
>       -   Although the PCs and the routers’ internal interfaces have identical private addresses, perhaps my router’s external interface has the public IP address `203.0.113.1`, and the other router has the public IP address` 203.0.113.5`. Although the private IP addresses aren’t unique, the public IP addresses must be globally unique.
>       -   When my devices needs to reach destinations over the Internet, NAT will allow it to borrow the *unique public IP address of my router*, or *another public IP address I have configured for NAT*. All devices can use that same single public IP address to access the Internet, all at the same time.

## NAT

>   -   NAT is used to translate the **source and/or destination IP address** of a packet to a different IP address.
>   -   There are various reasons to use NAT, but the most common reason is *to allow hosts with private IP addresses to communicate with other hosts over the Internet*.
>   -   There are also various types of NAT, but for the CCNA you have to understand **source NAT** and how to configure it on Cisco routers.



### NAT terms

>   -   **Global addresses**: Addresses used *after* NAT translations. These are usually the **public addresses** used on the Internet;
>   -   **Local addresses** are the ones we use *before* NAT translation. Local address is actually the **private address** of the sending host.

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Wolfxin/MyPicGo/img/202207111514611.png" alt="image-20220711151415529" style="zoom:67%;" />

>   -   `Inside local`: inside host(source address) before translation;
>   -   `Inside global`: Public IP address of inside host after translation;
>   -   `Outside global`: Public IP address of outside destination host before translation
>   -   `Outside local`: destination host after translation



### A brief demonstration of how **Source NAT** works.

>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304261757101.png" alt="image-20230426175703986" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   PC1’s IP address is `192.168.0.167`, and it wants to communicate with the server at `8.8.8.8`.
>
>   -   So, it creates a packet with source IP 192.168.0.167 and destination 8.8.8.8. 
>   -   It sends the packet to its default gateway, **R1. This is where the NAT happens.**
>
>   -   R1 translates the source IP address from `192.168.0.167` to `203.0.113.1`, the IP address of its external interface. That’s why it’s called ‘**source NAT**', because it translates the source IP address.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304261802290.png" alt="image-20230426180242135" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   -   R1 then sends the packet out to the Internet and it arrives at its destination, `8.8.8.8`. 
>
>   -   Now the server will send a reply. The source is `8.8.8.8`, and the destination is `203.0.113.1`. It sends the packet to R1, which then reverses the translation, `203.0.113.1` is translated back to `192.168.0.167`. 
>
>       >   Although in this case the destination IP is being changed, this isn’t destination NAT. R1 s just reverting the previously translated address back to PC1’s actual IP address.
>
>   -   And then finally the server’s response reaches PC1. 
>
>   Note that, in this case R1 translated PC1’s IP to the IP address of its own interface, 203.0.113.1, but that’s only one option. There are many different kinds of NAT will be talked later.



## Static NAT

### Introduction

#### Basic function

>   -   Static NAT involves statically configuring **one-to-one** mappings of private IP addresses to public IP addresses.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304262346396.png" alt="image-20230426234629307" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   -   An **inside local IP** address is mapped to an **inside global IP** address.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304262316924.png" alt="image-20230426231656690" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304262318715.png" alt="image-20230426231851568" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   >   Static NAT allows devices with private IP addresses to communicate over the Internet. However, because it requires a **one-to-one** IP address mapping, **it doesn’t really help preserve IP addresses**.
>
>   -   If you have already statically mapped a private IP address to a public IP address, if you try to map another private IP to that same public IP, the command will be rejected. Here’s what that looks like.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304270001840.png" alt="image-20230427000116738" style="zoom:38%;" />

#### More about Static NAT

>   -   **Two-way connection**: This one-to-one mapping of IP addresses doesn’t only allow the internal host to access external resources, it also allows external hosts to access the internal host via the inside global address.
>

### Static NAT Configuration

>   -   `show ip nat translations` is a very useful SHOW command for NAT. Let me point out some important things here. 
>   -   First, when static NAT is used you will see the **entries permanently displayed** in the translations table. So, these two entries are permanent, 
>   -   but then whenever NAT is actually performed on R1, when the addresses are actually translated, *dynamic entries for those translations will also appear in this table*. For example, I sent some traffic from PC1 and PC2 to 8.8.8.8, so you can see these two entries. 
>   -   **Router doesn’t translate the port numbers when using static NAT.**

### Other useful commands

#### `clear ip nat translation *`

>   -   Even though I only configured static NAT, not dynamic NAT, each time the static NAT entries are actually used, dynamic entries are added to the NAT translation table for those translations. 
>   -   When PC1 and PC2 stop communicating with 8.8.8.8, these dynamic entries will eventually time out and be removed from the NAT translation table, but this command allows you to manually clear the table.
>   -   You can clear all of the dynamic translations in the NAT translation table with `clear ip nat translation *`, and then an asterisk`*`.
>   -   These static NAT entries won’t time out and can’t be deleted unless you remove the `ip nat inside source static` commands from the router.

#### `show ip nat statistics`

## Dynamic NAT

>   -   In dynamic NAT, the router *dynamically maps inside local addresses to inside global addresses* as needed.
>   -   The router makes those mappings automatically, and then clears the mapping when its no longer needed.
>   -   An ACL is used to identify which traffic should be translated. (ACLs can be used to indicate which traffic should be forwarded and which should be blocked, you already know that. But they can also be used **just to identify traffic**.)
>       -   If the source IP of a packet is **permitted** by the ACL, the source IP will be **translated by NAT**.
>       -   However if the source IP is **denied** by the ACL, **the source IP will NOT be translated. But that doesn’t mean the traffic will be dropped!** 
>   -   A NAT pool is used to define the available inside global addresses that can be used for translation. 
>       -   For example, on R1 I configured ACL 1, which permits `192.168.0.0/24` and denies all other traffic. I also configured NAT POOL1, with a range from `100.0.0.1` to `100.0.0.10`. That means if a packet with a source IP permitted by ACL 1 arrives, translate the source IP to an address from POOL1. 
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304270150550.png" alt="image-20230427015015370" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   >   In the example, the ACL specified a /24 subnet of inside local addresses, but the NAT pool only had 10 inside global addresses. So, there can only be 10 translations active at a time. What happens if there are no available addresses, but a packet arrives and needs NAT?
>   >
>   >   -   If a packet from another inside host arrives and needs NAT but there are no available addresses, the router will drop the packet. 
>   >   -   The host will be unable to access outside networks until one of the inside global IP addresses becomes available. 
>   >
>   >   **And how does that happen?**
>   >
>   >   -   Dynamic NAT entries will *time out automatically if not used*, or *you can clear them manually*. 
>
>   -   Although they are dynamically assigned, the mappings are still one-to-one(one inside local IP address per inside global IP address). 
>   -   If there aren’t enough inside global IP addresses available, if they are all currently being used, it is called ‘**NAT pool exhaustion**’.
>   -   Although both are one-to-one mappings, static NAT mappings are permanent. However dynamic NAT mappings are temporary, they will time out when they are no longer needed, and then another host can use that same public IP address. However, hosts are still unable to use the same public IP address at the same time. To do that, you have to use **PAT(Port Address Translation)**.

### Dynamic NAT Configuration

##### Check NAT Translations

>   -   **extended**: They are those UDP and ICMP temporary entries that were cleared after a minute. 



## PAT(NAT Overload)

>   -   PAT(Port Address Translation), which is also known as **NAT overload**, translates both the IP address and the port number of a packet(if necessary).
>   -   By using a unique port number for each communication flow between internal hosts and external hosts, a single public IP address can be used by many different internal hosts. (port numbers are 16 bits in length, which means there are over 65,000 port numbers.)
>   -   Then, the router will keep track of which **inside local address** is using which **inside global address and port**.
>   -   So, the router will keep track of the communication flows by using unique port numbers for each flow.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304291716673.png" alt="image-20230429171659451" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   -   Because many inside hosts can share a single public IP, **PAT is very useful for preserving public IP addresses**, and it is used in networks all over the world.
>   -   Of the three types we have covered, static NAT, dynamic NAT, and PAT, PAT is the most widely used because it allows so many inside hosts to share a single public IP address.

### PAT Configuration

It’s basically the same as dynamic NAT, you just add one keyword. 

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304291724493.png" alt="image-20230429172417152" style="zoom:35%;" />

>   -   first define the inside and outside interfaces. 
>   -   Then, define which traffic should be translated by using an ACL. Again, traffic permitted by the ACL will be translated. 
>   -   Then define the pool of inside global IP addresses. This time I defined a smaller range, from `100.0.0.0` to `100.0.0.3`. Chances are, unless the internal network is very large, you won’t need more than a single IP address, but this provides some scalability, some room for growth. 
>   -   Note that I still specified a prefix length of 24 bits. As long as the specified address range is in the same subnet, this specified prefix length doesn’t really matter. `100.0.0.0` through `100.0.0.3` all fit in the subnet 100.0.0.0/24, so the command is valid. 
>   -   Finally, the NAT statement itself. It’s the same as for dynamic NAT, except at the end you use the keyword `overload`.

##### Let’s take a look at the NAT translations and statistics on R1.

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304291726867.png" alt="image-20230429172659760" style="zoom:38%;" />

>   -   One big difference compared to regular dynamic NAT is that those one-to-one dynamic mapping entries aren’t displayed. That’s because, when using PAT, there are no one-to-one mappings, they’re many to one. Many inside local addresses to one inside global address. As you can see, both `192.168.0.167 and .168` are using `100.0.0.1`. 
>       -   It will use port number 63925 to track the communication flow between PC1 and 8.8.8.8,
>       -   and it will use port number 59549 to track the communication flow between PC2 and 8.8.8.8.

### One more way to configure PAT

probably the more common way, is to configure the router to use its own public IP address when translating the source IP of packets.

## 验证NAT配置

```sh
R1#show ip nat translations 
Pro Inside global      Inside local       Outside local      Outside global

# 查看IP NAT转换条目时，可能看到很多包含同一个目标地址的转换条目，这通常是由于有很多到同一台服务器的连接。


Router#debug ip nat  # 在该命令的每个调试输出行中，都包含发送地址、转换条目和目标地址

NAT: s=10.1.1.1->192.168.2.1, d=172.16.2.2 [2]
NAT: s=10.1.1.1->192.168.2.1, d=172.16.2.2 [3]
NAT*: s=172.16.2.2, d=192.168.2.1->10.1.1.1 [1]
# 注意到在最后一行输出中，开头有一个星号(*)。这表示分组在转换后被快速交换到目的地。什么是快速交换呢?下面简要地解释一下。快速交换有很多名称，也被称为基于缓存的交换，而另一个更准确的名称是"路由一次，交换多次"。在思科路由器上，使用快速交换进程来缓存第3层路由选择信息，供第2层进程使用，这旨在避免每次转发分组时都对路由选择表进行分析，让路由器能够快速转发分组。以进程方式交换分组(在路由选择表中查找)时，将相关的信息存储在缓存中，供以后使用，以提高路由选择速度。


R1#clear ip nat translation [*]   # 你可使用全局地址、本地地址和TCP (UDP) 端口指定要清除特定的转换条目，也可使用星号( * )清除所有的转换条目。然而，该命令只清除动态转换条目，而不会清除静态转换条目。

R1#show ip nat statistics     # 显示NAT配置摘要，并计算活动的转换条目数

ip nat translation max-entries
```
