## FHRP 首跳冗余协议

>   **First Hop Redundancy Protocols** (FHRPs) are network protocols used to **provide redundancy for the default gateway of hosts on a network**. 
>
>   -   They operate at Layer 3 of the OSI model, which is the network layer;
>   -   are used to ensure that if the primary gateway fails, a backup gateway will take over and provide connectivity for the hosts on the network.
>
>   There are THREE Layer 3 FHRPs, including:
>
>   1.  **VRRP(Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol)**: VRRP is a protocol that allows several routers to share the same IP address for a particular subnet. 
>       -   One router is designated as the master, and the others are designated as backups. 
>       -   If the master fails, one of the backups will take over and become the new master.
>   2.  **HSRP(Hot Standby Router Protocol)**: HSRP is similar to VRRP, but it was developed by Cisco Systems. 
>       -   It works by creating a *virtual IP address* and *MAC address* for the routers in a group. 
>       -   One router is designated as the **active router**, and the others are designated as **standby routers**. 
>       -   If the active router fails, one of the standby routers will take over and become the new active router.
>   3.  **GLBP(Gateway Load Balancing Protocol)**: GLBP is another protocol developed by Cisco Systems. 
>       -   It works by *allowing multiple routers to share the same virtual IP address*, 
>       -   but it also *load balances the traffic between them*. 
>       -   This means that multiple routers can actively participate in forwarding packets, which increases the available bandwidth for hosts on the network.
>
>   All of these Layer 3 FHRP protocols provide redundancy for the default gateway of hosts on a network, but they have different features and capabilities. The choice of protocol depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the network in question.

### 冗余网关的必要性

>   -   If there is only one connection to the Internet and it fails due to a hardware failure or something else, these PCs will no longer be able to reach the Internet.
>       -   In your home, losing Internet access for some time would be frustrating, but probably not a disaster.
>       -   For most modern businesses, however, it would be a huge problem.
>   -   So, we can use redundant connections to the Internet like this.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304021353381.png" alt="image-20230402135306202" style="zoom:25%;" />
>
>   -   But let’s stop and think about this, because it’s not so simple. In this network, let’s say R1’s IP address 172.16.0.254 is configured as the default gateway.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304021357161.png" alt="image-20230402135712952" style="zoom:25%;" />
>
>   -   Although R2 is available as a backup, the PCs don’t know that R1 is down and that they should switch to using R2 as their default gateway. So, how can we cause R2 to automatically become the new default gateway if R1 can no longer be used? That’s the role of a first-hop redundancy protocol, an FHRP.
>
>       >   ###### FHRP from Wikipeia:
>       >
>       >   A first hop redundancy protocol (FHRP) is a computer networking protocol which is designed to protect the default gateway used on a subnetwork by allowing two or more routers to provide backup for that address; in the event of failure of an active router, the backup router will take over the address, usually within a few seconds.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304021401258.png" alt="image-20230402140128043" style="zoom:25%;" />
>
>   -   Here’s how FHRPs do this:
>       -   The two routers share a VIP, a virtual IP address, for example 172.16.0.252.
>       -   Configure the PCs in the network to use that virtual IP as their default gateway, instead of the actual IP address of R1.
>       -   The routers have to negotiate their **roles(active router/standby router)** with each other by sending **multicast ‘Hello’ messages** to each other. Note that the actual terms, like active and standby, vary depending on which FHRP is being used.
>           -   R1 is the active, meaning it will act as the default gateway for the network.
>           -   R2 is the standby, meaning it will not function as the default gateway unless R1 fails.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304021406833.png" alt="image-20230402140614627" style="zoom:25%;" />

### 冗余网关的作用机制

>   -   Let's assume R1 need to send traffic to a destination in another network(8.8.8.8):
>
>       1.   Default gateway is 172.16.0.252, but It don’t know the MAC address yet.
>
>       2.   So, it sends an **ARP request** to learn the MAC address of 172.16.0.252.
>
>            >   STP prevents a broadcast storm by disabling some of the switch interfaces.
>
>            <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304021410761.png" alt="image-20230402141035511" style="zoom:25%;" />
>
>       3.   Both R1 and R2 have received the ARP request, and they both share the same virtual IP address(172.16.0.252). R1 as Active Router will send a unicast ARP reply with an **Virtual MAC address**.
>
>            >   Each FHRP uses a different virtual MAC address, and I will introduce them later.
>
>            <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304021416886.png" alt="image-20230402141644651" style="zoom:25%;" />
>
>       4.   The frame will be sent to R1, and then the packet will be sent over the Internet.
>
>            <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304021420040.png" alt="image-20230402142039809" style="zoom: 25%;" />
>
>   -   Now what if R1 goes down? After a few seconds, R2 will think ‘I haven’t received any ‘Hello’ messages from R1 recently...I will become the Active router!’.
>
>       <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304021422810.png" alt="image-20230402142231607" style="zoom:25%;" />
>
>   -   But how does it tell the other devices to send traffic to it instead of R1? 
>
>       -   Note that the end hosts, the PCs, actually don’t have to change their ARP tables. *Virtual IP address <-> Virtual MAC address.*
>
>       -   R2 needs to make the switches update their MAC address tables(*MAC address <-> Port*). So, R2 needs to send frames with a source MAC address of the virtual MAC address. To do this, it will send ‘**Gratuitous ARP** messages'.
>
>           >   -   Gratuitous ARP messages are ARP replies sent without being requested.
>           >   -   Gratuitous ARP messages are broadcast to the MAC address of all Fs, but normal ARP replies are unicast.
>
>       -   Because they are broadcast, all switches will receive the frames and update their MAC address table, changing the port of the Virtual MAC address to the one receives the ‘**Gratuitous ARP** messages'.
>
>   -   Now R2 becomes the active router, and all of the switches have updated their MAC address tables.
>

### 原网关重新上线

>   -   Now, what if R1 comes online again? Will it become the active router once again? 
>
>       -   No, it will become the standby router by default. Like the DR and BDR in OSPF, FHRPs are also ‘**non-preemptive**’. The current active router will not automatically give up its role, even if the former active router returns.
>
>           <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304021441638.png" alt="image-20230402144150439" style="zoom:25%;" />
>
>       -   However, although this is the default behavior, you can change this setting to make R1 preempt R2 and take back its active role automatically, so R2 will become the standby router again.
>
>   -   So, that was a basic overview of how first hop redundancy protocols(FHRPs) work. Most of such information applies to each of them.

### Summary of FHRPs

>   -   A virtual IP is configured on the two routers, and a virtual MAC is generated for the virtual IP.
>       -   Each FHRP uses a different format for the virtual MAC address.
>   -   An active router and a standby router are elected. Again, different FHRPs use different terms, and some support what’s called an ‘active-active’ setup, with two active routers at the same time;
>   -   End hosts in the network are configured to use the virtual IP as their default gateway.
>   -   The active router replies to ARP requests using the virtual MAC address, so traffic destined for other networks will be sent to it.
>   -   If the active router fails, the standby becomes the next active router. 
>       -   The new active router will send **Gratuitous ARP messages** so that switches will update their MAC address tables. It now functions as the default gateway for the network.
>   -   If the old active router comes back online, by default it won’t take back its role as the active router. It will become the standby router.
>       -   But, in FHRPs you can configure ‘**preemption**’, so that the old active router does take back its old role if it comes back online.



## HSRP

>   -   **Hot Standby Router Protocol**, Cisco proprietary
>   -   In HSRP, an **Active and Standby router** are elected.
>   -   There are two versions: version 1(by default) and version 2(*NOT compatible with each other*). 
>       -   Version 2 adds IPv6 support and increases the number of *groups* that can be configured.
>   -   只有Active Router才会响应End hosts的ARP请求和转发数据; 
>       -   Active Router is determined in this order:
>           -   **Highest HSRP Interface Priority**: 0~255(100 by default);
>           -   **Highest IP address** on the interface within the subnet;
>       -   Standby 路由器:
>           -   Standby路由器监听 224.0.0.2的hello消息, 一旦发现active出现问题(holdtime = 10s), 立刻从Standby升级成为 active 路由器;
>   -   Active and Standby Routers communicate with each other by sending multicast IPv4 Hello messages:
>       -   V1: **224.0.0.2**
>       -   V2: **224.0.0.102** 
>   -   Virtual MAC address formats:
>       -   v1 = **0000.0c07.ac**XX (XX = HSRP group number) 
>       -   v2 = **0000.0c9f.f**XXX (XXX = HSRP group number)
>   -   In a situation with multiple subnets/VLANs, you can *configure a different active router in each subnet* to **load balance**. For example, R1 could be the active router in VLAN1 and standby in VLAN2, and R2 could be the standby in VLAN1 and active in VLAN2.

>
>   >   **Subnets divide the network at Layer 3, and VLANs divide the network at Layer 2, and they work together, each subnet being its own VLAN.**



### Configuring HSRPv2

>   In our lab today, there was just one subnet, 10.0.1.0/24, and one VLAN. 
>
>   -   But in situations with multiple subnets and VLANs, you’ll need to configure a virtual IP address for each subnet, because each subnet needs its own default gateway. Each of those virtual IPs is configured in a separate HSRP group.

## VRRP

>   -   **Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol**, open industry standard
>
>   In terms of functionality they are nearly identical, with just a few differences:
>
>   -   Instead of an *active and standby* router, a **master and backup** router are elected. The function is the same, just the names are different.
>   -   The IPv4 multicast address used is **224.0.0.18**.
>   -   Virtual MAC address: **0000.5e00.01**XX (XX = VRRP group number)
>   -   In a situation with multiple subnets/VLANSs, you can configure a different master router in each subnet/VLAN to load balance.

## GLBP

>   -   **Gateway Load Balancing Protocol**, Cisco proprietary
>   -   Here’s the big difference from HSRP and VRRP: **it load balances among multiple routers within a single subnet.** For example, if PC1 and PC2 are both in VLAN1, PC1 can use R1 as its default gateway, and PC2 can use R2 as its default gateway.
>   -   In GLBP, a single **AVG(Active Virtual Gateway)**, is elected for the subnet.
>   -   Then, up to four **AVFs(Active Virtual Forwarders)**, are assigned by the AVG(the AVG itself can be an AVF too).
>   -   Each AVF acts as the default gateway for a portion of the hosts in the subnet.
>   -   The multicast IPv4 address is **224.0.0.102, same as HSRP version 2**.
>   -   Virtual MAC address: **0007.b400.XXYY** (XX = GLBP group number, YY = AVF number)
