# Simple Network Management Protocol

## Overview of SNMP

>   -   SNMP is an industry-standard framework and protocol that was originally released in 1988.
>
>   -   Most people think of SNMP as a single protocol, but actually it fits into a larger framework of network management, sometimes called the **SNMP framework**.
>
>   -   SNMP can be used to monitor the status of devices, make configuration changes, etc.
>
>   -   **SNMP version 1** was made up of:
>
>       -   The first RFC was **RFC 1065**, structure and identification of management information for TCP/IP-based internets.
>       -   The next RFC for SNMP was **RFC 1066**, management information base for network management of TCP/IP-based internets.
>       -   And one more, **RFC 1067**, a simple network management protocol.
>
>       >   Don’t let the ‘simple’ in the name fool you! Although SNMPv1 was relatively simply compared to the later versions, the current version SNMPv3 is **actually fairly complicated**.
>
>   -   There are two main types of devices in SNMP:
>
>       -   **Managed Devices**: 
>
>           devices being managed using SNMP. For example, network devices like routers and switches.
>
>       -   **Network Management Station/System**(NMS, aka. **SNMP Server**):
>
>           This is the device/devices, managing the managed devices I mentioned above.

## How SNMP works?

>   -   In this network, SRV1 is the NMS, Network Management Station/System.
>   -   We’re using SNMP to manage R1 and SW1, so they are the managed devices.

### There are three main operations used in SNMP:

>   -   *Managed Devices can notify the NMS of events.* 
>   
>    For example, perhaps SW1’s G0/1 interface had a hardware failure and it’s status changed to DOWN. It can send an SNMP message to the NMS, SRV1, telling it that the G0/1 interface has gone down. The actual SNMP software on the server, or the NMS, might be configured to notify the network administrator to inform them of this event, for example.

>   
>-   *The NMS can also ask the managed devices for information about their status.*
>   
>    For example, perhaps the NMS, SRV1, asks R1 what its current CPU usage is. You want to make sure your network devices aren’t being overloaded. R1 will then reply to the NMS, for example telling SRV1 that its CPU usage is at 50%.

>   
>-   *The NMS can tell the managed devices to change aspects of their configuration.*
>   
>    For example, let’s say the IP address of R1’s G0/1 interface is `203.0.113.1/30`. The NMS can tell R1 to change that IP address to `203.0.113.5/30`. R1 will change the IP address and tell the NMS that it did so.

### SNMP Components

>   ##### NMS
>
>   Let this green section represent the **SNMP software** on the NMS. The NMS probably isn’t a machine dedicated to SNMP. It could just be the network admin’s PC which is running SNMP software. 
>
>   -   **SNMP Manager** is the SNMP software on the NMS that interacts with the managed devices.
>       -   It receives notifications, sends requests for information, sends configuration changes, etc.
>   -   **SNMP Application** provides an interface for the network admin to interact with. 
>       -   It displays alerts, statistics, charts, etc. Here’s what an SNMP Application might look like. There are plenty of free and commercial SNMP applications available. This screenshot is from **SolarWinds**.

>   ##### Managed Devices
>
>   SW1 and R1 from our example before. The blue area represents the SNMP entity on the managed devices. And of course SNMP is just a part of what’s running on these devices.
>
>   -   **SNMP Agent**:  is the SNMP software running on the managed devices that interacts with the SNMP Manager on the NMS.
>       -   It sends notifications to and receives messages from the NMS.
>   -   **MIB(Management Information Base)**: is the structure that contains the variables that are managed by SNMP. 
>       -   Each of these variables is identified with an **Object ID**(OID).
>       -   Some examples of variables stored in the MIB: 
>           -   status of each interface on the device, 
>           -   the traffic throughput,
>           -   CPU usage, 
>           -   device temperature, etc.
>
>   >   ###### SNMP OIDs
>   >
>   >   -   SNMP Object IDs are organized in a hierarchical structure.
>   >   -   Here’s an example of an OID, and here’s how it breaks down. So, this OID is used to identify the **system name(the host name)**, of the managed device.

## Brief overview of the major SNMP versions

>   Many versions of SNMP have been proposed and developed, however only three major versions have achieved wide-spread use.
>
>   -   **SNMPv1**: this is the original version of SNMP.
>   -   **SNMPv2c**: There are multiple versions of SNMPv2, but v2c is the most widely used. 
>       -   Version '2' added another message type which *allows the NMS to retrieve large amounts of information from a managed device using a single request, making it much more efficient*, there is less unnecessary network traffic.
>       -   The ‘c’ in the name refers to the ‘**community strings**’, which are **passwords** that were used in SNMPv1, removed from SNMPv2, and then added back for this version(SNMPv2c).
>   -   **SNMPv3**:  is the next major version and the best version so far.
>       -   It is a much more secure version of SNMP that supports strong **encryption** and **authentication**. *Whenever possible, this version should be used!*
>       -   basically it means that SNMPv3 makes sure that only the intended devices can read the SNMP messages, they can’t be intercepted and read by an attacker.

## SNMPv2c Configuration

>   setting up the NMS is definitely out-of-scope for the CCNA, you can learn it later.

### Configure the SNMP agent on a Cisco router.

>   In this network, R1 is the managed device, and PC1 is the NMS, running an SNMP application.

>
>   1.   First I configured some *optional* information on R1, giving some contact information and the location of the device. 
>   2.   Then I configured two **community strings**. As I mentioned before, these are basically **SNMP passwords**. Note that there are actually default community strings, ‘public’ for **ro** and ‘private’ for **rw**, but not secure. 
>        -   Notice that I specified the community string Jeremy1 as **ro**, this means read only. So, an NMS using this password can only read information from R1, it can’t use Set to make any changes to R1.
>        -   I specified Jeremy2 as **rw**, read/write. An NMS using this password will be able to both read, using Get messages, and write,
>   3.   Then I specified the address of the NMS, PC1 at 192.168.1.1. In this command I also specified the version and which community string to use with this server. I configured Jeremy1, so PC1 will be able to read information from R1, but it won’t be able to use Set messages to make changes to R1. So, the read/write community string Jeremy2 isn’t being used in this configuration.
>   4.   Then I configured what kinds of traps to send to the NMS. 
>        -   I specified `linkdown` and `linkup` messages, so if an interface goes up or down Traps will be sent.
>        -   I also specified config traps, so for example if configuration changes are made Traps will be sent.

##### Let’s see what happens when R1’s G0/1 interface goes down.

Here’s a Wireshark capture of the Trap that was sent from R1 to the NMS, PC1.

>   -   as you can see it is a linkDown Trap, notifying the NMS that R1’s interface went down.
>   -   **version: v2c**
>   -   **community: Jeremy1** Note that this community string, this password, is displayed in plain text. In SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c, there is no encryption. The community and message contents are sent in plain-text. This is not secure, as the packets can easily be captured and read. So, as I mentioned before SNMPv3 is the preferred option. However SNMPv3 configuration is also more complicated, so for this simple demonstration I selected version 2c.

## SNMP Summary

>   -   SNMP helps manage devices over a network.
>   -   There are two main components of SNMP. 
>       -   The **managed devices** are the devices being managed using SNMP, such as network devices, for example routers, switches, and firewalls.
>       -   The network management stations, NMS, are the SNMP servers that manage the devices.
>           -   The NMS receives notifications from managed devices. 
>           -   It can change the settings on managed devices. 
>           -   It can also check on the status of managed devices.
>   -   Variables(such as interface status, temperature, traffic load, host name, etc) are stored in the MIB of the managed devices, and each variable is identified using an object ID, OID.
>   -   There are three main SNMP versions:
>       -   SNMPv1, 
>       -   SNMPv2c, 
>       -   SNMPv3: is preferred because it is more secure than the previous versions, providing encryption and authentication of SNMP messages.
>   -   SNMP messages we covered: Get, GetNext, GetBulk, Set, Trap, Inform, and Response.
