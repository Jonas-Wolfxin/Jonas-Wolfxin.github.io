# Virtualization

>   Virtualization is an essential part of cloud services. If you want to really go in depth about these topics, consider looking into certifications from cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP, or VMware certifications for virtualization.

## Intro to Virtualization 

### Virtual servers

#### Server Hardware

>   -   Although Cisco is more known for their networking devices(routers, switches, and firewalls), they also offer hardware servers such as their **UCS(Unified Computing System)**.

>
>   -   The largest vendors of hardware servers include Dell EMC, HPE, and IBM, etc.

#### Servers before Virtualization

>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202305151233361.png" alt="image-20230515123306251" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   -   Before virtualization, there was a one-to-one relationship between a physical server and an operating system. 
>   -   In that operating system, apps providing services such as a web server, email server, etc would run.
>   -   One physical server would be used for the web server, one for the email server, one for the database server, etc. 
>       -   Now, it is possible to run all servers in a single operating system on a single physical server, but this is not a good idea. Because if the servers aren’t isolated from each other, a problem on a single app could affect all of the other apps. 
>   -   However, **using one physical server per app is inefficient for multiple reasons**:
>       -   Each physical server is expensive and takes up space, power, etc.
>       -   The resources on each physical server (CPU, RAM, Storage, NIC(Network Interface Card)) are typically under-used.

#### Virtualization

##### Type 1 Hypervisor

>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202305151234476.png" alt="image-20230515123454369" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   -   Virtualization allows us to break the one-to-one relationship of hardware to OS, allowing multiple OS’s to run on a single physical server. 
>   -   Each instance is called a **VM (Virtual Machine)**. 
>   -   A **hypervisor** is used to manage and allocate the hardware resources (CPU, RAM, etc) to each VM. Another name for a hypervisor is **VMM (Virtual Machine Monitor)**. 
>   -   The type of hypervisor which *runs directly on top of the hardware* is called a **Type 1 hypervisor**. — Examples include **VMware ESXi**, **Microsoft Hyper-V**, etc. Type 1 hypervisors are also called **bare-metal hypervisors** because they run directly on the hardware (metal). Another term is **native hypervisor**. 
>   -   This is the type of hypervisor used in **data center environments**.

##### Type 2 Hypervisor

>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202305151242113.png" alt="image-20230515124202000" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   -   **Type 2 hypervisors** run as a program on an operating system like a regular computer program. Another name for a type 2 hypervisor is **hosted hypervisor**.
>       -   Examples include **VMware Workstation** and **Oracle VirtualBox**.
>   -   The OS running directly on the hardware is called the **host OS**, and the OS running in a VM is called a **guest OS**. 
>   -   Although Type 2 hypervisors are rarely used in data center environments, they are common on **personal-use devices** (for example, if a Mac/Linux user needs to run an app that is only supported on Windows, or vice versa).

#### Why Virtualizaiton?

>   Virtualization provides 
>
>   -   partitioning: 
>       -   Run multiple operating systems on one physical machine 
>       -   Divide system resources between virtual machines.
>   -   Isolation: 
>       -   Provide **fault and security isolation** at the hardware level. 
>       -   Preserve performance with advanced resource controls.
>   -   Encapsulation: 
>       -   Save the entire state of a virtual machine to files. 
>       -   Move and copy virtual machines as easily as moving and copying files.
>   -   Hardware Independence: 
>       -   Provision or migrate any virtual machine to any physical server.

#### Benefits of Virtualization

>   -   reduced capital & operating costs
>       -   fewer physical servers, as well as less space, power, and cooling
>       -   less work to setup
>   -   Minimized or eliminated downtime
>       -    it’s easy to deploy a VM to multiple physical servers for redundancy.
>   -   Increased productivity, efficiency, agility, and responsiveness:
>   -   Faster provisioning of applications and resources.
>       -   It’s much quicker to add a new VM than ask your boss for approval to order a new physical server, order the server, wait for it to arrive, mount it on the rack, connect the cables, configure it, etc.



### Virtual networks

briefly explain how VMs can connect to each other and to the external network, outside of the physical host. 

-   VMs are connected to each other and the external network via a virtual switch running on the hypervisor.
-   The hypervisor will provide a virtual switch to use, or alternatively you can run a Cisco virtual switch on the hypervisor, for example. Just like a regular switch, the vSwitch’s interfaces can run as access or trunk ports and use VLANs to separate the VMs at Layer 2.
-   Interfaces on the virtual switch then connect to the physical NIC or NICs of the server to communicate with the external network.

## Intro to Cloud Computing

>   -   Traditional IT infrastructure deployments were some combination of the following: 
>
>       -   **On-Premises** 
>           -   All servers, network devices, and other infrastructure are located on company property.
>           -   All equipment is purchased and owned by the company using it. 
>           -   The company is responsible for the necessary space, power, and cooling.
>
>       -   **Colocation** 
>           -   Data centers that rent out space for customers to put their infrastructure (servers, network devices).
>           -   The data center provides the space, electricity, and cooling.
>           -   The servers, network devices, etc are still the responsibility of the end customer, although they are not located on the customer’s premises.
>
>   -   Cloud services provide an alternative that is hugely popular, and is continuing to grow. 
>
>   -   Most people associate ‘cloud’ with public cloud providers such as AWS.
>
>   -   The American NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) defined cloud computing in SP (Special Publication) 800-145.  <https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-145/final>
>
>   >   **Cloud computing** is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model is composed of **five essential characteristics**, **three service models**, and **four deployment models**.
>
>   -   To understand what the cloud is, let’s look at the following outlined in SP 800-145:
>       -   Five essential characteristics 
>       -   Three service models 
>       -   Four deployment models
>

### Essential Characteristics

>   The five essential characteristics of cloud computing are:
>
>   -   **On-demand self-service**: The customer is able to use the service (or stop using the service) freely (via a web portal) without direct communication to the service provider.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202305161317826.png" alt="image-20230516131741708" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   -   **Broad network access**: The service is available through standard network connections (ie. the Internet or private WAN connections), and can be accessed through many kinds of devices.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202305161320196.png" alt="image-20230516132018078" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   -   **Resource pooling**: A pool of resources is provided by the service provider, and when a customer requests a service (for example creates a new VM), the resources to fulfill that request are allocated from the shared pool.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202305161322850.png" alt="image-20230516132201633" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   -   **Rapid elasticity**: Customers can quickly expand the services they use in the cloud (for example, add new VMs, expand storage, etc) from a pool of resources that appears to be infinite. Likewise, they can quickly reduce their services when not needed. 
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202305161323445.png" alt="image-20230516132308278" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   -   **Measured service**: The cloud service provider measures the customer’s usage of cloud resources, and the customer can measure their own use as well. Customers are charged based on usage (for example, X dollars per gigabyte of storage per day).
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202305161324101.png" alt="image-20230516132404936" style="zoom:33%;" />



### Service Models

>   -   In cloud computing, everything is provided on a ‘service’ model. 
>   -   For example, rather than the end user buying a physical server, mounting it on a rack, installing the hypervisor, creating the VMs, etc, the service provider offers all of this as a service.
>
>   There are a variety of services referred to as ‘__ as a Service’ or ‘__aaS’. **The three service models of cloud computing are**:
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202305161332133.png" alt="image-20230516133239017" style="zoom:73%;" />
>
>   -   **Software as a Service (SaaS)** 
>       -   The service provider is basically in control of everything, from the physical data center, to the networks in the data center, to the servers, the operating systems on the servers, all tools running on the operating systems, and the applications themselves. 
>       -   The end user, the customer, simply uses the application, ie. **Microsoft Office 365**, **Google’s G Suite** which includes Gmail, are popular examples of SaaS. 
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202305161328680.png" alt="image-20230516132808456" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   -   **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: 
>       -   The service provider is in control of the data centers, the networking and security, the servers and storage, and operating systems on the servers, as well as the tools running on the operating systems. 
>       -   This provides a platform that the **customer can use to develop their own applications**. For example **AWS Lambda** and **Google App Engine** are two popular offerings.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202305161333747.png" alt="image-20230516133325512" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   -   **Infrastructure as a Service (LaaS)**:
>       -   The service provider takes care of the physical data center, the network and security, and server and storage infrastructure. **The service provider just offers the underlying infrastructure**.
>       -   This provides infrastructure that the customer can use for basically any purpose they want. So, IaaS offers the most control to the customer. Examples of IaaS services include **Amazon EC2** and **Google Compute Engine**.
>

### Deployment Models

>   -   Most people assume that ‘cloud’ means public cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and GCP.
>   -   Although ‘Public cloud’ is the most common deployment model, it’s not the only one.
>
>   The four deployment models of cloud computing are:
>
>   -   **Private cloud** 
>       -   Private clouds are generally only used by large enterprises.
>       -   Although the cloud is private, it may be owned by a third party. For example, AWS provides private cloud services for the American DoD(department of defense).
>       -   Private clouds may be on or off premises. Many people assume that cloud and on-prem are two different things, but that is not always the case.  
>       -   The same kinds of services offered are the same as in public clouds (SaaS, PaaS, laaS), but the infrastructure is reserved for a single organization.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202305161345062.png" alt="image-20230516134504887" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   -   **Community cloud** 
>       -   This is the least common cloud deployment.
>       -   Similar to private cloud, but the infrastructure is reserved for use by only a specific group of organizations.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202305161349630.png" alt="image-20230516134911446" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   -   **Public cloud** 
>       -   This is the most common cloud deployment. 
>       -   Popular public cloud service providers include: 
>           + AWS (Amazon Web Services) AWS has been a dominant number one for a long time
>
>           + Microsoft Azure 
>
>           + GCP (Google Cloud Platform) 
>
>           + OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) 
>
>           + IBM Cloud 
>
>           + Alibaba Cloud
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202305161350725.png" alt="image-20230516135026579" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   -   **Hybrid cloud**
>       -   This is basically any combination of the previous three deployment types.
>       -   For example, a private cloud which can offload to a public cloud when necessary.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202305161351078.png" alt="image-20230516135147935" style="zoom:33%;" />

### Benetits of Cloud Computing

>   -   **Cost**: CapEx (Capital Expenses) of buying hardware and software, setting up data centers etc. are reduced or eliminated.
>   -   **Glocal Scale**: Cloud services can scale globally at a rapid pace. Services can be set up and offered to customers from a geographic location close to them.
>   -   **Speed/Agility**: Services are provided on demand, and vast amounts of resources can be provisioned within minutes.
>   -   **Productivity**: Cloud services remove the need for many time-consuming tasks such as procuring physical servers, racking them, cabling, installing and updating operating systems, etc.
>   -   **Reliability**: Backups in the cloud are very easy to perform. Data can be mirrored at multiple sites in different geographic locations to support disaster recovery.



### Connecting to Public Clouds

There are multiple ways a company can connect to their resources on a public cloud. 

-   For example, through a private WAN such as an **MPLS VPN**. 
-   Another option is to simply connect via the **Internet**. 
-   **VPN** can be used to provide a secure connection over the Internet to the resources on the cloud.

## Containers

>   Containers are a similar technology to virtual machines so it’s important to understand both so we can compare them. Containers are a more recent virtualization technology being used more and more in recent days.

### Basic Intro

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202305162031739.png" alt="image-20230516203106613" style="zoom:33%;" />

>   -   **Containers** are software packages that contain an App and all dependencies(the binaries and libraries in the diagram) for the contained app to run.
>       -   Multiple Apps can be run in a single container, but this is not how containers are usually used.
>   -   Containers run on a **Container Engine**, for example **Docker** Engine which is the most popular one.
>       -   The container engine is run on a host OS (usually **Linux**).
>   -   Containers are lightweight (small in size) and include only the dependencies required to run the specific App.
>   -   The major difference between VMs and containers: VMs run an OS in each VM, whereas containers don’t.
>       -   All of the different costs and benefits of VMs vs containers come from that major difference.
>   -   A **Container Orchestrator** is a software platform for automating the deployment, management, scaling etc. of containers. 
>       -   **Kubernetes** (originally designed by Google) is the most popular container orchestrator.
>       -   **Docker Swarm** is Docker’s container orchestration tool.
>   -   In small numbers manual operation of containers is possible, but large-scale systems, (ie. with Microservices) can require thousands of containers.
