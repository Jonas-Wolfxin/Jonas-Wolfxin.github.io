# Syslog

>   Syslog is a protocol used to keep logs of various events that happen on the device, for example interfaces going up or down, OSPF neighbor relationships going up or down, etc. The log messages can be shown 
>
>   -   in real-time in the CLI of the device to inform you of important events as they occur, 
>   -   and they can also be stored in the device or on an external server and examined later. 
>
>   These logs are very important, so understanding Syslog is essential for network admins and engineers.

## Overview of Syslog

>   -   Syslog is an industry standard protocol for message logging. 
>   -   On network devices, Syslog can be used to log events such as changes in interface status, changes in OSPF neighbor status, or neighbor status in other routing protocols(like EIGRP and BGP), also system restarts, etc.
>   -   The messages can be **displayed in the CLI** as you configure the device, **saved in the device’s RAM**, or **sent to an external Syslog server**. 
>   -   Logs are essential when troubleshooting issues, examining the cause of incidents, etc. 
>   -   Syslog and SNMP are both used for monitoring and troubleshooting devices. They are complementary to each other, but their functionalities are quite different.



## Syslog message 

### Syslog Message Format

>   -   **sequence number** and **timestamp** fields may or may not be displayed, depending on the device’s configuration.
>   -   **facility**: this is a value that indicates which process on the device generated this message. For example, if OSPF generated the message when an OSPF neighbor came up, OSPF would be displayed in this field.
>   -   **severity**: indicates the severity of the event. There are 8 severity levels, and you’ll need to know them all for the exam.
>       -   Some messages are just informational, simply letting you know that something happened. 
>       -   Other messages indicate something much more serious that might need to be dealt with immediately.
>   -   **mnemonic**, which is a short code for the message that indicates what happened. 
>       -   I.e, if the facility is *OSPF*, this mnemonic might be a code indicating that the message is about OSPF neighbor adjacencies, *ADJCHG*. 
>       -   If the facility is *LINK*, it might be a code indicating that the message is about an interface going up or down(**UPDOWN**).
>       -   If the facility is *SYS* for *system*, the mnemonic might be **CONFIG_I**
>   -   **description**: is the detailed information about the event being reported, about what actually happened.

### Syslog Severity Levels

>   There are 8 severity levels, as displayed here. 
>
>   -   Each severity level has a number, 0 being the most severe and 7 being the least severe. 
>   -   Each level also has a keyword, which is a name identifying the level. 
>   -   Then there is a brief description. I took these descriptions directly from the official RFC for Syslog. The RFC doesn’t give detailed definitions about exactly what events fit into each severity level. So, each vendor will interpret these levels differently.

### Syslog Logging locations

Overview of the different locations Syslog messages can be sent to.

>   -   **Console line**: Syslog messages will be displayed when connected to the device **via the console port**. 
>       -   By default, all messages, from level 0 through level 7, are displayed. 
>       -   In Cisco Packet Tracer, for example, when you click on a device and go to the CLI tab, it operates as if you’re connected via the console port of the device.
>   -   **VTY lines**: Syslog messages will be displayed in the CLI when connected to the device via **Telnet** or **SSH**.
>       -   Logging to the VTY lines is **disabled by default**, so Syslog messages will not be displayed if you’re connecting to the device via Telnet or SSH. So, if you shutdown an interface, for example, no message will be displayed. 
>   -   **Buffer** of the device: Syslog messages will be saved to RAM. By default, all messages, from level 0 to level 7, will be displayed in the buffer.
>       -   the messages in the buffer can be viewed with the `show logging` command.
>   -   **External server**: You can also configure the device to send Syslog messages to an external server. 
>       -   This is very useful, especially in large networks, but also in small networks. Having a central server for the Syslog messages makes network management easier and makes it easier to compare the logs of multiple devices. 
>       -   Syslog servers will listen for Syslog messages on **UDP port 514** on itself. So, if a device sends a Syslog message to a Syslog server, the destination port will be UDP 514.

## Syslog Configuration

##### Basic Configuration

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304251259043.png" alt="image-20230425125952721" style="zoom:32%;" />

```sh
SW1(config)#logging ?
  A.B.C.D   IP address of the logging host
  buffered  Set buffered logging parameters
  console   Set console logging parameters   # enabled by default, but here’s how you configure it.
  host      Set syslog server IP address and parameters
  on        Enable logging to all enabled destinations
  trap      Set syslog server logging level
  
SW1(config)#logging buffered ?
  <4096-2147483647>  Logging buffer size
  <cr>
  
# The size is optional, if you don’t specify it the device will use its default size. Just be careful not to set the buffer size too large, because that can take system memory away from other essential operations. 
# Also to repeat, to specify the logging level, you can use either the number or the keyword, and it enables logging for not only level 6 but also levels 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0. 
```

##### Terminal monitor

>   -   Even if logging monitor Level is enabled, by default Syslog messages will not be displayed when connected via Telnet or SSH.
>   -   For the messages to be displayed, you must use the following command from privileged exec mode: 
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304251302756.png" alt="image-20230425130208696" style="zoom:30%;" />
>
>   -   But not only that, this command must be used every time you connect to the device via Telnet or SSH. 
>       -   So, if you connect via SSH and use the `terminal monitor` command, Syslog messages will be displayed as you configure the device. 
>       -   However, after you log out, that ‘session’ is finished and the TERMINAL MONITOR command is no longer effective. To display Syslog messages in the CLI when you connect again next time, you’ll need to use the `terminal monitor` command again.

##### logging synchronous

>   This next command isn’t essential, but very convenient. By default, logging messages displayed in the CLI while you are in the middle of typing a command will result in something like this. 
>

>
>   To prevent this, you should use the `logging synchronous` command on the appropriate line.

>
>   This will cause a new line to be printed if your typing is interrupted by a message.

## Comparison of Syslog and SNMP

>   -   Syslog and SNMP are both used for monitoring and troubleshooting of devices, both within the device and likely to an external Syslog server They are complementary, but their functionalities are different.
>   -   Syslog is used for message logging.
>       -   Events that occur within the system are categorized based on facility and severity and logged. 
>       -   Syslog is used for system management, analysis, and troubleshooting.
>       -   Messages are sent from the devices to the server, but the server can’t actively pull information from the devices(like an SNMP Get) or modify variables on the devices(like an SNMP Set message).
>   -   SNMP is used to retrieve and organize information about the SNMP managed devices.
>       -   IP addresses, current interface status, device temperature, CPU usage, etc are stored as variables and organized within the MIB. 
>       -   SNMP servers can use Get to query the clients and Set to modify variables on the clients.
>
>   Syslog and SNMP are used together to facilitate network device management, and you need to be familiar with both of them.
