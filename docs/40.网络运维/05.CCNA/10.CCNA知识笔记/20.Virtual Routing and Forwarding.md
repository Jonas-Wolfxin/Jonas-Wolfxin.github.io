# Virtual Routing and Forwarding

>   VRF allows us to **divide one physical router into multiple virtual routers**. 

## Intro to VRF

>   The diagram above gives an idea of how VRFs work. The black box in the middle represents R1, a single physical router. The blue, green, and red router icons inside represent three virtual routers inside R1, three VRFs. Let’s call them VRF1, VRF2, and VRF3.

>   -   Virtual Routing and Forwarding is used to divide *a single router* into *multiple virtual routers*.
>       -   VLANs divide a switch into multiple virtual switches each with their own **broadcast domain**,
>       -   VRF divides a router into multiple virtual routers each with their own **routing table**.
>   -   It does this by allowing a router to build multiple separate routing tables.
>       -   Normally a router has one routing table, but with VRF it has multiple.
>       -   Interfaces (Layer 3 only) & routes are configured to be in a specific VRF (aka VRF Instance). **Router interfaces**, **SVIs & routed ports on multilayer switches** can be configured in a VRF.
>   -   Traffic in one VRF cannot be forwarded out of an interface in another VRF. 
>       -   As an exception, **VRF Leaking** can be configured to allow traffic to pass between VRF’s.
>   -   VRF is commonly used to f**acilitate MPLS(multi-protocol label switching)**. 
>       -   However, the kind of VRF we are talking about here is **VRF-lite**(VRF without MPLS).
>   -   VRF is commonly used by service providers to **allow one device to carry traffic from multiple customers**.
>       -   **Each customer’s traffic is isolated from the others**, because each customer connects to their own virtual router within the service provider’s physical router.
>       -   **Customer IP addresses can overlap without issues.**

## VRF Configuration

>   -   SPR1 is a service provider router providing WAN services to two customers, Customer 1 and Customer 2.
>   -   C1R1 and C1R2 belong to Customer 1 and C2R1 and C2R2 belong to customer 2.
>   -   Both Customer 1 and Customer 2 use subnet 192.168.1.0/30. 

##### Demo Configuration without VRF

##### Next let’s use VRF to configure this network properly.

>   1.   First we have to create the VRFs, which can be done in global config mode with the command `ip vrf VRF_Name`;
>   2.   The next step is to assign interfaces to each VRF. From *interface config mode*, use the command `ip vrf forwarding VRF_Name`.
>   3.   Re-configure the IP address on the interfaces and enable the interfaces;
