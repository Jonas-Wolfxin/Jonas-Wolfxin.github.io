# Network Time Protocol

>   All computers have an internal clock, including network devices. It’s important that these devices have an accurate clock that is synchronized with other devices, which is the purpose of the NTP.

## Why is time synchronization important for network devices?

>   -   All devices have an internal clock (routers, switches, your PC, etc);
>   -   In Cisco IOS, you can view the time with the `show clock` command.
>
>   ```sh
>   R1#show clock 
>   *16:0:12.222 UTC Sun Feb 28 1993
>   # Remember that, the default time zone is UTC, Coordinated Universal Time.
>   
>   R1#show clock detail 
>   *16:0:15.353 UTC Sun Feb 28 1993  
>   # the Asterisk * means that this time is not considered authoritative.
>   Time source is hardware calendar
>   # The hardware calendar is the built-in internal clock of the device. This is the time source by default.
>   ```
>
>   -   Remember that, the default time zone is UTC, Coordinated Universal Time.
>   -   The Asterisk ***** means that this time is not considered authoritative.
>   -   The internal hardware clock of a device will drift over time, so it is not the ideal time source.
>
>   ###### Reason from CCNA perspective:
>
>   From a *CCNA perspective*, or really the perspective of most network engineers, the most important reason to have accurate time on a device is **to have accurate logs for troubleshooting**.
>
>   -   Devices keep logs of various events that occur, such as an interface being enabled or disabled, OSPF neighbor relationships being formed or broken, device restarts, etc.
>
>   -   Syslog, the protocol used to keep device logs, is a CCNA exam topic and will be covered in other chapters.
>
>       -   The command to view a device’s logs is `show logging`. 
>
>           Let’s say I’m a network admin and I got a phone call around 1AM saying that the network connection has been unstable. So, to investigate I log into one of the devices and check the logs.
>

>
>   This is going to make it much more difficult to correlate the logs of these devices. When you have to troubleshoot more complex issues on devices with logs full of thousands of messages, it gets much more difficult and accurate time is very important.

## Manual Time Configuration

### Software Clock Configuration

>   -   You can manually configure the time on the device with the `clock set` command in **priviledged-Exec mode**.
>
>   ```sh
>   R1#clock set ?
>     hh:mm:ss  Current Time
>     
>   R1#clock set 12:03:25 ?
>     <1-31>  Day of the month
>     MONTH   Month of the year
>     
>   R1#clock set 12:03:25 ?
>   <1-31>  
>   
>   R1#clock set 12:03:25 22 ?
>     MONTH  Month of the year
>   	
>   R1#clock set 12:03:25 22 April ?
>     <1993-2035>  Year
>   R1#clock set 12:03:25 22 April 2023 ?
>     <cr>  # cr(carriage return), basically means press the enter key to enter the command.
>     
>   R1#clock set 12:03:25 22 April 2023
>   
>   
>   R1#show clock detail 
>   12:3:45.109 UTC Sat Apr 22 2023
>   Time source is user configuration
>   ```
>
>   -   The time source also has changed to ‘**user configuration**’.
>   -   These clock configurations aren’t part of the device’s running configuration, they are separate.
>   -   Although the hardware calendar (the built-in clock) is the default time-source, the hardware clock and software clock are separate and can be configured separately.

### Hardware Clock Configuration

>   -   manually configure the hardware clock with the `calendar set` command, the command syntax is the same as `clock set`, only the keyword `calendar `is different.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304221214389.png" alt="image-20230422121438252" style="zoom:35%;" />
>
>   -   Typically you want to synchronize the `clock `and `calendar`. 
>       -   Use the command `clock update-calendar` to sync the calendar to the clock’s time.
>       -   Use the command `clock read-calendar` to sync the clock to the calendar’s time.

### Configuring the Time Zone

>   -   The time zone is important because, as you’ll see soon, NTP only uses UTC, so you have to adjust each device to the correct time zone.
>   -   You can configure the time zone with the `clock timezone` command in Global Config mode.
>
>   ```sh
>   R1#conf t
>   Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
>   R1(config)#clock timezone ?
>     WORD  name of time zone
>   # This is just a word, the device doesn’t actually check if it’s the name of a real time zone.
>     
>   R1(config)#clock timezone Berlin ?
>     <-23 - 23>  Hours offset from UTC
>     
>   R1(config)#clock timezone Berlin 2 ?
>     <0-59>  Minutes offset from UTC
>     <cr>
>     
>   R1(config)#clock timezone Berlin 2 0 ?
>     <cr>
>     
>   R1(config)#clock timezone Berlin 2 0 
>   
>   
>   R1#show clock detail 
>   14:22:34.934 Berlin Sat Apr 22 2023
>   Time source is user configuration
>   ```

### Daylight Saving Time(Summer Time)

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304221831858.png" alt="image-20230422183133599" style="zoom:43%;" />

>   -   During daylight saving time, the name changes to EDT(customized name by admin);
>   -   Then we can set a specific date to change to daylight saving time with the keyword **date**;
>   -   but the more useful option is the second one, **recurring**. This makes summer time start and end on the specified days every year.
>   -   After recurring, we specify which week in the month it will **start**.
>       -   In **Canada** it starts on the second Sunday of March, so I specified 2.
>       -   Next is the weekday, so I entered Sunday.
>       -   After that it’s the Month, March for Canada.
>       -   Finally the time, I entered 2AM.
>   -   Now we enter the end of daylight saving time in the same order.
>       -   1 for the first week, the weekday, Sunday, the month, November, and finally the time 2AM.
>   -   Optionally you can specify the offset, but the default is **60 minutes** and I think that’s what most countries use by default.
>   -   So, that’s all for the command.
>
>   >   Notice the dollar signs here. This command is a little long, too long for one line, so these dollar signs mean that some of the output is cut off and can’t be displayed on a single line in the terminal. The whole command is shown here:

### Summary

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304221842185.png" alt="image-20230422184214992" style="zoom:30%;" />

## Network Time Protocol

>   -   Manually configuring the time on devices is not scalable(*(of a network) able to be expanded to cope with increased use*), which would be a huge task and a huge waste of time.
>   -   Not only that, the manually configured clocks will drift(漂移), resulting in inaccurate time.
>   -   **NTP allows automatic syncing of time over a network to NTP servers.** 
>   -   NTP clients request the time from NTP servers. 
>   -   A device can be **an NTP server and an NTP client at the same time**.
>   -   NTP allows accuracy of time within ~1 millisecond if the NTP server is in the same LAN, or within ~50 milliseconds if connecting to the NTP server over a WAN/the Internet.
>   -   Some NTP servers are ‘better’ than others. The ‘distance’ of an NTP server from the original **reference clock** is called **stratum**.
>   -   NTP uses **UDP** port **123** to communicate.
>
>   ###### Example:
>
>   For example, on my Windows 10 PC you can see that my computer is set to automatically synchronize with `time.windows.com`.
>

>   通过`nslookup`指令将指定域名解析为IP地址:

### Reference Clocks

>   -   A reference clock is usually a very accurate time device like an atomic clock or a GPS clock.
>
>   -   **Reference clocks are stratum 0 within the NTP hierarchy**. They are as close to the time source as possible, because they are the **time source**.
>   -   NTP servers *directly connected to reference clocks* are stratum 1.
>
>   ###### Example:
>
>   Here’s an example of a reference clock, this one is from a United States Naval observatory.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304221901662.png" alt="image-20230422190123130" style="zoom:43%;" />
>
>   -   Cisco devices aren’t able to get their time directly from a stratum 0 reference clock like this, but they can get their time from a stratum 1 NTP server.

### NTP Hierarchy:

>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304221905949.png" alt="image-20230422190506687" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   Note: 
>
>   -   **An NTP client can sync to multiple NTP servers.** 
>   -   NTP servers which get their time directly from reference clocks(aka. Stratum 1 NTP servers) are also called **primary servers**.
>   -   NTP servers which get their time from other NTP servers are called **secondary servers**, like Stratum 2, 3, ... NTP Servers. They operate in **server mode and client mode at the same time**.

### NTP Configuration Lab

>   I’m showing you an actual screenshot of my **GNS3** topology to show you this.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304221912974.png" alt="image-20230422191249839" style="zoom:53%;" />
>
>   -   Through this Internet cloud in GNS3, these virtual routers are actually connected to **the real Internet**, and in this demonstration I will **make R1 sync to Google’s NTP servers** over the Internet. This is a cool part of GNS3 that isn’t available in simulators like **Cisco Packet Tracer**. 
>   -   Now, you might be wondering why this point-to-point connection between R1 and the Internet is using a **/24 prefix length**. That’s just how this cloud is configured by default in GNS3. For a real point-to-point connection to an Internet Service Provider I’d use a **/30 or /31 prefix length**. 

#### Make R1 sync to Google’s NTP servers

>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304221917703.png" alt="image-20230422191707501" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   I’ll be configuring all four of these IPv4 addresses on R1 as NTP servers.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304221918196.png" alt="image-20230422191839098" style="zoom:37%;" />
>
>   -   R1 will ask all of them for the time and select whichever gives the best, quickest responses. And the one it selects to sync to might change if the currently selected server’s responses start slowing down or it stops responding altogether(全部地, 完全地).
>
>   >   So, **it’s best to specify multiple NTP servers** so that R1 can always have a reliable source of time. 
>
>   
>
>   Now, if you want to manually make the device prefer one of the configured servers, you can add **PREFER** to the end of the command.
>

#### 查看R1上的NTP配置状态:

##### shows all of the NTP servers

with `show ntp associations`

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304221923774.png" alt="image-20230422192327627" style="zoom:33%;" />

>   -   address field:
>       -   Notice the **asterisk *** next to 216.239.35.0, meaning ‘**sys.peer**’. This means that *this is the NTP server that R1 is currently syncing to*.
>       -   This **plus sign +** next to the other servers means they are **candidates**, but R1 is not currently syncing its time to them.
>       -   The **tilde ~** next to all of the servers simply means that they were configured.
>       -   If you see an NTP server marked as an ‘**outlyer -**’ or ‘**falseticker x**’ it means R1 will not sync to that server, for example R1 might think its time is inaccurate.
>   -   ref clock field:
>       -   Here you can see the **reference clock** of each NTP server. All of these servers are using Google’s own reference clock as their reference. 
>       -   That is a stratum 0 reference clock, so here in the ‘st’ column you can see that all four of these servers have a stratum level of 1.

##### 查看R1上的NTP状态

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304221933057.png" alt="image-20230422193338853" style="zoom:35%;" />

>   -   *Clock is synchronized*: means that at least one of the NTP servers we configured was good and R1 was able to sync to it.
>   -   *Stratum 2*, this is R1’s stratum. Because R1 is synchronizing its time to Google’s NTP severs(Stratum 1), it automatically becomes an NTP server itself(*with a stratum level 2*) higher than Google’s NTP servers(*Stratum 1*).
>   -   `reference is 216.239.35.12`: the address of the reference clock for R1.

##### 确认R1上的clock和calendar时间是否已同步NTP

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304221942401.png" alt="image-20230422194218219" style="zoom:33%;" />

>   -   NTP uses only the UTC time zone. You must configure the appropriate time zone on each device.
>   -   I also used the `do show calendar` command. Notice that the time is not synced up with the software clock. 
>   -   NTP doesn’t update the calendar by default, but let’s excute `ntp update-calendar` so that it does update.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304221947596.png" alt="image-20230422194706410" style="zoom:33%;" />

>   ##### You might be wondering why you would want to sync the hardware clock.
>
>   -   The hardware clock tracks the date and time on the device even if it restarts, power is lost, etc.
>
>   -   When the system is restarted, the hardware clock is used to initialize the software clock.
>   -   So, it’s a good idea to keep the hardware clock accurate, although it’s not totally essential.

#### configure NTP on R2

>   -   Usually in a small network like this you’d just configure all of the devices to sync to public NTP servers like Google’s.
>   -   But for the purpose of this lesson I’ll **configure R2 to use R1 as an NTP server**.

>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304221956775.png" alt="image-20230422195616592" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   1.   But before doing that, I’ll configure a loopback interface on R1. Note that I’ve configured OSPF in this network so all of these routers are sharing routes including the route to R1’s loopback interface.
>   2.   I also instructed R1 to use loopback0 as the source of its NTP messages with the `ntp source loopback0`, So, any NTP messages it sends will come from the address `10.1.1.1`.
>
>   >   **As a reminder, remember to use the `NTP SOURCE` command to specify the loopback interfaceas the source of NTP packets on R1.**
>
>   >   ###### Why configure a loopback interface?
>   >
>   >   -   Well, let’s say I configured R2 to use 10.0.0.1, R1’s G0/1 interface, as an NTP server. In normal situations it would be able to send NTP request messages and get replies from R1:
>   >
>   >   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304221959043.png" alt="image-20230422195942933" style="zoom:33%;" />
>   >
>   >   -   But what if the interface failed for some reason?
>   >
>   >       R2 would suddenly lose its NTP server, because the availability of address 10.0.0.1 is dependent on the status of R1’s G0/1 interface.
>   >
>   >   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304222000511.png" alt="image-20230422200040401" style="zoom:33%;" />
>   >
>   >   -   But what if we configure this loopback interface on R1 and tell R2 to use its address, `10.1.1.1` as its ntp server? Even if the closest path to R1, via R2’s G0/0 interface, is down, R3 will still advertise a route to 10.1.1.1 to R2 and therefore R2 will still be able to communicate with its ntp server R1.(I gave a similar demonstration of why loopback interfaces are useful in the OSPF videos.)
>   >
>   >   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304222005215.png" alt="image-20230422200531105" style="zoom:33%;" />

Okay, so on R2 I configured NTP SERVER `10.1.1.1`, and then checked `do show ntp associations`.

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304222006030.png" alt="image-20230422200635879" style="zoom:33%;" />

>   -   Google’s reference clock is stratum 0, *Google’s NTP servers are stratum 1*, 
>   -   and now R1 is stratum 2;
>   -   R2’s stratum is 3, because it got its time from a stratum 2 server, R1.

#### Configure NTP on R3

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304222014058.png" alt="image-20230422201432982" style="zoom:38%;" />

>   Before that, configure a loopback interface on R2 as well, that’s 10.2.2.2. and excute `ntp source 10.2.2.2` on R2.

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304222016100.png" alt="image-20230422201608978" style="zoom:33%;" />

>   -   Because of the stratum levels, R1 with a stratum level is selected as the preferred NTP server on R3.

### Configuring NTP Server mode

>   -   We can make a Cisco device sync to a specified NTP server using the `ntp server NTP_Server_IP_Address` in the **Global Config mode**;
>   -   **If a device is syncing to an NTP server, meaning it’s in `static client mode`, it also automatically can act as an NTP server too, and other devices can sync to it.** 
>   -   But what if there is no NTP server to sync to? You probably still want the devices in the network to have the same time, even if it is slightly inaccurate compared to the actual time.
>   -   So, how can you manually configure a Cisco device to operate as an NTP server, even though it isn’t synced to another NTP server? Using the command `ntp master`.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304222024092.png" alt="image-20230422202434842" style="zoom:36%;" />

>
>   -   However I chose to just enter the command `ntp master`, which means it will use the **default stratum level**(of 8).
>       -   Basically, **R1 is using itself as its reference clock, with a default stratum level of 7**. Remember, the entire `127.0.0.0/8` address range is reserved for loopback addresses.
>       -   So, **the default stratum of the NTP MASTER command is 8**.
>
>   >   ###### Loopback interfaces Vs Loopback Addresses:
>   >
>   >   -   **Loopback interfaces** are virtual interfaces in the router and their addresses can be advertised to other devices using dynamic routing protocols like OSPF etc.
>   >   -   **Loopback addresses** are a totally different concept, these addresses are **totally internal to the local device and can’t be reached by other devices**.

<details>
    <summary>Answer:</summary>
    <p>
        <strong>a) The command ntp master 9 would make its stratum level of 9, which would also make its Reference Clock(127.127.1.1 on itsself)'s stratum level of 9-1 = 8.</strong>

### Configuring NTP sysmatric active mode

>   Let’s configure symmetric active mode between R2 and R3.
>
>   -   They **both have a stratum level of 9**, so they are equals in terms of NTP.
>   -   **They can become peers and help each other sync their time, and also act as backups in case they lose contact with R1.**
>   -   The command to configure symmetric active mode is `ntp peer Peer's_IP Address `;

### Configuring NTP Authentication

>   -   NTP authentication can be configured, but it is optional. You don’t need to configure it.
>   -   It allows NTP clients to **ensure that they only sync to the intended servers**. They will check that the server is using the same password as them, and only sync if they are the same.
