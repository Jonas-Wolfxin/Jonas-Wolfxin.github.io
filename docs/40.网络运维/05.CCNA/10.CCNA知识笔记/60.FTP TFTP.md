## The purpose of FTP/TFTP 

### Quick summary of FTP and TFTP

>   -   FTP(File Transfer Protocol) and TFTP(Trivial File Transfer Protocol) are both industry standard protocols used to transfer files over a network. 
>   -   They can be used to transfer *all kinds of files* between *different devices* over a network. They both use a **client-server** model.
>       -   Clients can use FTP or TFTP to copy files from an FTP or TFTP server.
>       -   Clients can also use FTP or TFTP to copy files to a server.
>   -   As a network engineer, the most common use for FTP and TFTP is in the process of **upgrading the operating system of a network device**.
>   -   You can use FTP or TFTP on the device to download the newer version of IOS and then *reboot the device with the new IOS image*.

## FTP/TFTP functions & differences

### TFTP

>   -   TFTP was first standardized in 1981. 
>   -   Named ‘**Trivial**’ because it is simple and has only basic features(**Nothing else, just simple file transfers**) compared to FTP.
>       -   *Only allows a client to copy a file to or from a server*. 
>   -   was released after FTP, but it’s not a replacement for FTP. It is just another tool to use when a **lightweight, simple protocol** is more important than advanced functionality.
>   -   **No authentication** (username/password), so **servers will respond to all TFTP requests**.
>   -   **No encryption**, so all data is sent in plain text.
>   -   Because of this lack of security, TFTP is best used in a controlled environment to transfer small files quickly.
>   -   TFTP servers listen on **UDP port 69**. 
>   -   (As you already know, UDP is connectionless and doesn’t provide reliability using retransmissions.) However, TFTP actually has similar built-in connection and reliability features within the TFTP protocol itself.

#### TFTP provides reliability using acknowledgments and retransmissions

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304260810328.png" alt="image-20230426081012164" style="zoom:33%;" />

>   -   Every TFTP data message is acknowledged.
>       -   If the client is transferring a file to the server, the server will send Ack messages.
>       -   If the server is transferring a file to the client, then the client will send Ack messages.
>   -   Timers are used, and if an expected message isn’t received in time, the waiting device will re-send its previous message.
>   -   The server will never send two data messages in a row, for example, except in the case of retransmission. So, **this method of reliability isn’t as efficient as TCP’s forward acknowledgment and sliding window**, but it gets the job done.

####  TFTP Connections

>   TFTP file transfers have three phases:
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304260822440.png" alt="image-20230426082223334" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   1.   **Connection** phase: TFTP client sends a request to the server, and the server responds back, initializing the connection.
>   2.   **Data Transfer** phase: data and acknowledgment messages are exchanged. 
>   3.   **Connection Termination** phase: After the last data message has been sent, a final acknowledgment is sent to terminate the connection.

#### TFTP TID

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304260828186.png" alt="image-20230426082853064" style="zoom:33%;" />

>   -   when the client sends the first message to the server, the destination port is UDP port 69 and the source is a **random ephemeral port**. 
>   -   In TFTP, this random port is called a ‘**Transfer Identifier**’(TID), and is used to *identify that particular data transfer*.
>   -   The server then also selects a **random TID** to use as the **source port** when it replies, **not 69**.
>   -   When the client sends the next message, the destination port will be the server’s TID, **not 69**.
>   -   And the devices continue to use these two random ports throughout the data transfer. 
>   -   So, **TFTP’s well-known port of 69 is only used in the very first message from the client to the server.** 

### FTP

>   -   FTP was first standardized in 1971. (This is actually before TCP and IP, so FTP is a very old protocol, although it has of course been updated since.) 
>   -   FTP uses **TCP ports 20 and 21**;
>   -   Usernames and passwords are used for authentication. However, just like in TFTP, there is no encryption(Everything is sent in plain text, including the username and password.).
>   -   For greater security, 
>       -   **FTPS(FTP over SSL/TLS)** can be used. This protocol is also called **FTP Secure**.
>       -   Another option is **SFTP(SSH File Transfer Protocol)**. Note that *FTPS is an upgrade FTP*, adding greater security, whereas *SFTP is a different protocol that just has a similar name*.
>   -   FTP is more complex than TFTP and allows not only file transfers, but clients can also *navigate file directories*, *add and remove directories*, *list files*, etc.
>   -   The client sends FTP commands to the server to perform these functions. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_FTP_commands>

#### FTP Connections

>   FTP uses two types of connections.
>
>   -   **FTP Control Connection**: **FTP control connection to TCP port 21** is established and used to send FTP commands and replies. (The client sends commands when it wants to perform an action, such as retrieving a file from the server, and the server sends replies to acknowledge.)
>   -   **FTP Data Connection**: When files or data are to be transferred, separate **FTP data connections to TCP port 20** are established and terminated as needed. 

>   ##### FTP Control Connection
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304260843663.png" alt="image-20230426084323550" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   -   The client initiates the TCP connection, and the usual **SYN**, then **SYN**-**ACK**, then **ACK** exchange is used. Now the FTP control connection is established. 
>   -   The client will send FTP commands to the server, and the server replies to acknowledge the command.
>   -   But now we need an FTP data connection to actually transfer the data.
>
>   
>
>   ###### Two Modes to establish an FTP data connection
>
>   There are actually two different modes which can be used to establish an FTP data connection.
>
>   -   The **default method** of establishing FTP data connections is **active mode**, in which *the server initiates the TCP connection*.
>
>       >   Also, note that the FTP control connection is maintained throughout this whole process. It isn’t terminated, so there are two active connections.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304260849848.png" alt="image-20230426084921632" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   -   In FTP **passive mode**, *the client initiates the data connection*. This is often necessary when the client is behind a firewall, which could block the incoming connection from the server.

## IOS File Systems

>   -   A file system is a way of controlling how data is stored and retrieved. 
>   -   You can view the file systems of a Cisco IOS device with the command `show file systems`. 
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304260903468.png" alt="image-20230426090353251" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   -   Note that there are quite a few file systems.
>   -   note that there are different types of file systems:
>       -   The **disk** type refers to **storage devices** such as flash memory. This is usually where the Cisco IOS file itself is stored. When the device boots up, it copies the IOS file from flash into RAM.
>       -   The **opaque** disk type is used for specific internal functions. These refer to *logical internal systems*, not actual separate storage devices. T
>       -   The NVRAM type refers to the **NVRAM(Non-Volatile RAM)**, of the device. *Normal RAM* loses all of its data when the device loses power. **However NVRAM does not.** The **startup-config** file is stored in NVRAM. 
>       -   There is also the **network** type. This represents *external file systems*, for example FTP or TFTP servers.

## Using FTP/TFTP in IOS

Here’s a very simple network we’ll use to demonstrate how to use TFTP and FTP to transfer files into the flash memory of Cisco devices.

>   -   R1 is a Cisco router running Cisco IOS, and we have downloaded a new version of IOS and saved it on SRV1. 
>   -   SRV1 is a server running both TFTP and FTP, and we’ll try out both of them to get the new version of IOS from SRV1 onto R1. 

### view the current version of IOS

>   -   First, you can view the current version of IOS running on R1 with `show version`:
>       -   Here you can see the image name, `C2900-UNIVERSALK9-M`. Notice the **K9**, meaning it supports cryptographic features like **SSH**.
>       -   Then the version number, `15.1(4)M4`. 
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304260924711.png" alt="image-20230426092458603" style="zoom:33%;" />
>
>   -   You can view the contents of flash with `show flash`
>       -   you can see the IOS image here.
>
>   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304260926500.png" alt="image-20230426092618388" style="zoom:33%;" />

### Use FTP/TFTP  to transfer the  Cisco IOS image

>   Use TFTP to copy a new version of IOS from SRV1 to the flash of R1, and configure R1 to boot with the new version of IOS, and then finally delete the old version from flash.

#### Copying Files(TFTP)

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304260930645.png" alt="image-20230426093020296" style="zoom:33%;" />



#### Use FTP to transfer the  Cisco IOS image

I’ll only show the process of transferring the file from the server to the router, because the rest is the same.

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Jonas-Wolfxin/MyPicgo/img/202304261532861.png" alt="image-20230426153207647" style="zoom:33%;" />

>   -   First, you should configure the username and password that the router will use when connecting to an FTP server. **Remember, FTP authenticates using a username and password.** So, this same username and password must be configured on the server, too.
>   -   Then the copy command itself is basically the same, `copy ftp: flash:` , and then enter the FTP server’s IP address, the source file name, and the name you want to save the file as on the local router. That’s it.



### Upgrading Cisco IOS

>   -   Here you can see the new version of IOS that was copied from the TFTP server. 
>   -   Now, how do we make the router use this file as its OS instead of the old file? From global config mode, use the command `boot system`, followed by the *filepath*.
>   -   After that, make sure you save the Running-configuration before reloading the device(, or the BOOT SYSTEM command won’t take effect.)
>   -   Then simply use the RELOAD command to restart the device.

#### Check the IOS version and delete the old one
