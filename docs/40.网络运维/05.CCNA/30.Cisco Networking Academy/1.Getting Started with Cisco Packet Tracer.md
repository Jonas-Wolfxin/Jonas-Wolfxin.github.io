## what is Cisco Packet Tracer?

The free Cisco Packet Tracer software helps you to practice your network configuration and troubleshooting skills using your desktop or laptop computer. It allows you to simulate networks without having access to physical equipment. In addition to networking, you can learn, and then practice your Internet of Things (IoT) and Cybersecurity skills. You can choose to build a network from scratch, use a pre-built sample network, or complete lab assignments. While Packet Tracer is not a replacement for practicing on physical routers, switches, firewalls, and servers, it provides many benefits!

### Download Cisco Packet Tracer

To obtain and install your copy of Cisco Packet Tracer, please follow the instructions from the link below: <https://skillsforall.com/resources/lab-downloads>

## The Packet Tracer User Interface

Packet Tracer is a tool that allows you to simulate real networks. It provides three main menus that you can use for the following:

-   Add devices and connect them via cables or wireless
-   Select, delete, inspect, label, and group components within your network
-   Manage your network



The network management menu lets you do the following:

-   Open an existing/sample network
-   Save your current network
-   Modify your user profile or your preferences

## GUI and CLI Configuration in Cisco Packet Tracer

Packet Tracer also provides a variety of tabs for device configuration including the following:

-   Physical
-   Config
-   CLI
-   Desktop
-   Services



The tabs that are shown depend on the device you are currently configuring.

**Note**: You may see other tabs on different devices. These additional tabs are beyond the scope of this course.

### Physical Tab

>    The Physical tab provides an interface for interacting with the device including powering it on or off or installing different modules, such as a wireless network interface card (NIC).

### Config Tab

>   For intermediate devices such as routers and switches, there are two ways to access device configurations. Configurations can be accessed via a Config tab, which is a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Configurations can also be accessed using a command line interface (CLI).
>
>   The Config tab does not simulate the functionality of a device. This tab is unique to Packet Tracer. If you don’t know how to use the command line interface, this tab provides a way to use a Packet Tracer-only GUI to configure basic settings. As settings are changed in the GUI, the equivalent CLI commands appear in the **Equivalent IOS Commands** window. This helps you to learn the CLI commands and the Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS) while you are using the Config tab.
>
>   For example, in the figure, the user has configured **MyRouter** as the name of the device. The Equivalent IOS Commands window shows the IOS command that achieves the same results in the CLI.
>
>   In addition, device configuration files can be saved, loaded, erased, and exported here.

### CLI Tab

>   The CLI tab provides access to the command line interface of a Cisco device. Using the CLI tab requires knowledge of device configuration with IOS. Here, you can practice configuring Cisco devices at the command line. CLI configuration is a necessary skill for more advanced networking implementations.
>
>   **Note**: Any commands that were entered from the Config tab are also shown in the CLI tab.

### Desktop Tab

>   For some end devices, such as PCs and laptops, Packet Tracer provides a desktop interface that gives you access to IP configuration, wireless configuration, a command prompt, a web browser, and other applications.

### Services Tab

>   A server has all of the functions of a host with the addition of one more tab, the Services tab. This tab allows a server to be configured with common server processes such as HTTP, DHCP, DNS, or other services, as shown in the figure.

## Packet Tracer Tutored Activity - Logical and Physical Mode Exploration

## Cisco Packet Tracer File Types

Packet Tracer has the ability to create four different types of files. These file types are used for different purposes and include: .pka, .pkt, .pksz, and .pkz.

### The .pka file type

>   The .pka file type is a Packet Tracer Activity file and is the file type you will experience most often. Think of the “a” in .pka as meaning “activity.” A Packet Tracer Activity has an instructions window. The activity is usually scored as well. This file type contains two networks: an initial network and an answer network. The initial network opens when you launch the activity. The answer network runs in the background and can be used to provide scoring and feedback to learners as they complete the activity. Learners do not have access to the answer network in a .pka file.
>
>   The Packet Tracer Activity instructions window provides the procedures required to complete the activity, assignment, or assessment. The instructions window can also display completion percentage to track how much of the activity has been successfully completed. The Check Results feature can be enabled to provide feedback.

### The .pkt file type

>   The .pkt file type is created when a simulated network is built in Packet Tracer and saved. The .pkt file can also have graphic background images embedded within it. However, .pkt files have no instructions window or activity scoring.

### The .pksz file type

>   The .pksz file type is specific to Packet Tracer Tutored Activities (PTTA). These files bundle a .pka file, media assets, and a scripting file for the hinting system. These activities provide support, in the form of contextualized hints, for students who are working on completing the activity.

### The .pkz file type

>   You will see Save As PKZ... in the File menu. This file type was previously used to embed images and other files in a Packet Tracer file. However, images are now embedded directly within a regular .pkt or .pka file by default. Therefore, consider .pkz as a **deprecated** file type.

## Cisco Packet Tracer Assessments

There are two types of assessment items that take advantage of Packet Tracer. These include Packet Tracer Media Objects (PTMO) and Packet Tracer Skills Assessments (PTSA). PTMOs can be either a .pkt or .pka file. A PTMO will show up inline with a question on your quiz, module exam, or some other type of graded assessment. You launch the .pkt or .pka file directly from inside the assessment. Typically, you configure the network or investigate the topology, and then answer a multiple choice assessment question or questions.

You can encounter PTSAs at a mid-point in a course or at the end of the course. PTSAs are summative skill assessments in which you demonstrate your skill by implementing the technologies that you have learned. PTSAs are standalone assessments, have their own grading engine, and the results are recorded in a course gradebook, if there is one. After completing a PTSA, you receive item level feedback for each graded component.
