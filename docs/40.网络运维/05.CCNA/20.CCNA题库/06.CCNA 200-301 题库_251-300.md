       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>D</strong>
           <em>Explanation: </em>
           <ul>
               <li>BPDU Guard feature protects the port from receiving STP BPDUs, however the port can transmit STP BPDUs. When a STP BPDU is received on a BPDU Guard enabled port, the port is shutdown and the state of the port changes to ErrDis (Error-Disable) state.</li>
               <li>BPDU guard is enabled only on access ports where laptops, servers or other device are connected. If some one generate PBDU's from end devices PBDU guard will put the port in to erro-disable state</li>
