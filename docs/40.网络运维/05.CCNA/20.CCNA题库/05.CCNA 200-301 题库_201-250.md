204.   A wireless administrator has configured a WLAN; however, the clients need access to a less congested 5-GHz network for their **voice quality**. What action must be taken to meet the requirement?

       A. enable AAA override

       B. enable RX-SOP

       C. enable DTIM

       D. enable Band Select

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>D</strong>
           <em>Explanation: </em>
           <ul>
               <li>The 2.4-GHz band is often congested. Clients on this band typically experience interference from Bluetooth devices, microwave ovens, and cordless phones as well as co-channel interference from other access points because of the 802.11b/g limit of three non-overlapping channels. You can use this feature to combat these sources of interference and improve overall network performance. Band direction enables client radios that are capable of dual-band (2.4- and 5-GHz) operation to move to a less congested 5-GHz access point. </li>
               <li>Band selection works by regulating/suppressing probe responses from the clients? 2.4 GHz radio. It makes 5-GHz channels more attractive to clients by delaying probe responses on the 2.4-GHz channels. The feature is disabled by default. The configurable options are defined globally (Wireless > Advanced > Band Select), but the feature itself can be enabled per WLAN (WLAN > Advanced > Client Band Select). This is useful if you want to disable band selection for a select group of clients (such as time-sensitive voice clients).</li>

205.   What mechanism carries **multicast traffic between remote sites and supports encryption**?

       A. ISATAP

       B. GRE over iPsec

       C. iPsec over ISATAP

       D. GRE

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>B</strong>
           <em>Explanation: </em>
           <ul>
               <li>IPsec cannot encapsulate multicast, broadcast, or non-IP packets, and GRE cannot authenticate and encrypt packets. Based on the same principle, these applications encapsulate packets as IP packets using GRE and then transmit the packets over IPsec tunnels</li>
               <li>ISATAP is Short for Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol, ISATAP is a method of transmitting IPv6 packets on an IPv4 network that is most recently defined in RFC 5214. ISATAP works by mapping an IPv4 address into the IPv6 address and requires an ISATAP gateway on the IPv6 Internet and the IPv4 intranet.</li>
               <li>On Windows side, The Microsoft ISATAP device is a Inter Site Automatic Tunneling Address Protocol is used to help enterprises transition to an IPv6 infrastructure. The ISATAP adapter encapsulates IPv6 packets by using an IPv4 header. This functionality enables the client to transport IPv6 traffic over an IPv4 infrastructure.</li>

       D. to be a marking mechanism that identifies different flows

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>C</strong>
           <em>Explanation: </em>
           <ul>
               <li>If a link becomes utilized to the point where there is a significant level of congestion, latency can rise substantially. Traffic shaping can be used to prevent this from occurring and keep latency in check. Traffic shaping provides a means to control the volume of traffic being sent into a network in a specified period (bandwidth throttling), or the maximum rate at which the traffic is sent (rate limiting), or more complex criteria such as generic cell rate algorithm. This control can be accomplished in many ways and for many reasons; however traffic shaping is always achieved by delaying packets.</li>
               <li>The primary reasons you would use traffic shaping are to control access to available bandwidth, to ensure that traffic conforms to the policies established for it, and to regulate the flow of traffic in order to avoid congestion that can occur when the sent traffic exceeds the access speed of its remote, target interface.</li>

229.   A **port security violation** has occurred on a switch port due to *the maximum MAC address count being exceeded*, which command must be configured to increment the security-violation count and forward an SNMP trap?

       A. switchport port-security violation access

       B. switchport port-security violation protect

       C. switchport port-security violation restrict

       D. switchport port-security violation shutdown

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>C</strong>
           <em>Explanation: </em>
           <ul>
               <li>Protect – When a violation occurs in this mode, the switchport will permit traffic from known MAC addresses to continue sending traffic while dropping traffic from unknown MAC addresses. When using this mode, no notification message is sent when this violation occurs. In other words, Drops packets with unknown source addresses until you remove a sufficient number of secure MAC addresses to drop below the maximum value.</li>
               <li>Restrict – When a violation occurs in this mode, the switchport will permit traffic from known MAC addresses to continue sending traffic while dropping traffic from unknown MAC addresses. However, unlike the protect violation type, a message is also sent indicating that a violation has occurred. In other words, Drops packets with unknown source addresses until you remove a sufficient number of secure MAC addresses to drop below the maximum value and causes the SecurityViolation counter to increment.</li>
               <li>Shutdown – When a violation occurs in this mode, the switchport will be taken out of service and placed in the err-disabled state. The switchport will remain in this state until manually removed; this is the default switchport security violation mode. In other words, Puts the interface into the error-disabled state immediately and sends an SNMP trap notification.</li>
           </ul>

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>B</strong>
           <em>Explanation: </em>
           <ul>
               <li> Dynamic Auto — Makes the Ethernet port willing to convert the link to a trunk link. The port becomes a trunk port if the neighboring port is set to trunk or dynamic desirable mode. This is the default mode for some switchports.</li>
               <li>Dynamic Desirable — Makes the port actively attempt to convert the link to a trunk link. The port becomes a trunk port if the neighboring Ethernet port is set to trunk, dynamic desirable or dynamic auto mode.</li>

242.   which two QoS tools are used to **guarantee minimum bandwidth to certain traffic**?

       A. FIFO

       B. LLC

       C. CBWFQ

       D. RSVP

       E. WFQ

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>CE</strong>
           <em>Explanation: </em>
           <ul>
               <li>First In First Out (FIFO) is just what it sounds like – there is no priority traffic, no traffic classes, no queueing decision for the router to make. This is the default for all Cisco router interfaces, with the exception of Serial interfaces running at less than E1 (2.048 MBPS) speed. FIFO is fine for many networks, and if you have no problem with network congestion, FIFO may be all you need. If you’ve got traffic that’s especially time-sensitive such as voice and video, FIFO is not your best choice.</li>
               <li>(Flow Based) Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ) prevents one particular stream of network traffic, or flow, from using most or all of the available bandwidth while forcing other streams of traffic to sit and wait.  Flow-Based WFQ takes these packet flows and classifies them into conversations. WFQ gives priority to the interactive, low-bandwidth conversations, and then splits the remaining bandwidth fairly between the non-interactive, high-bandwidth conversations.</li>
               <li>(Class-Based) Weighted Fair Queuing There’s an advanced form of WFQ, Class-Based Weighted Fair Queuing (CBWFQ) that allows manual configuration of queuing – and CBWFQ does involve access list configuration.</li>
               <li>Low Latency Queuing (LLQ) is an “add-on” to CBWFQ that creates such a strict priority queue for such traffic, primarily voice traffic, allowing us to avoid the jitter that comes with voice traffic that is not given the needed priority queuing. (Cisco recommends that you use an LLQ priority queue only to transport Voice Over IP traffic.)
               <ul>
                   <li>WRED and LLQ can’t work together. Why? Because WRED is effective only with TCP-based traffic, and the voice traffic that will use LLQ’s priority queue is UDP-based. The random-detect and priority commands can’t be used in the same class.
       </li>
                   <li>By its very nature, LLQ doesn’t have strict queue limits, so the queue-limit and priority commands are mutually exclusive.</li>
