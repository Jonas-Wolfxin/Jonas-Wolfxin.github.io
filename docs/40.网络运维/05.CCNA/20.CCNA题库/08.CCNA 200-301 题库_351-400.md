351. What is the difference in data transmission delivery and reliability between TCP and UDP?

       A. TCP transmits data at a higher rate and ensures packet delivery. UDP retransmits lost data to ensure applications receive the data on the remote end.

       B. UDP sets up a connection between both devices before transmitting data. TCP uses the three-way handshake to transmit data with a reliable connection

       C. UDP is used for multicast and broadcast communication. TCP is used for unicast communication and transmits data at a higher rate with error checking.

       D. TCP requires the connection to be established before transmitting data. UDP transmits data at a higher rate without ensuring packet delivery.

       D. XML

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>A</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul>
               <li>In SDN, southbound interfaces is the OpenFlow protocol specification that enables communication between controllers and switches and other network nodes, which is with the lower-level components. This further lets the router to identify network topology, determine network flows and implement request sent to it via northbound interfaces.</li>
               <li>OpenFlow, which was developed by the Open Networking Foundation (ONF), is the first and probably most well-known southbound interface. OpenFlow defines the way the SDN Controller should interact with the forwarding plane to make adjustments to the network, so it can better adapt to changing business requirements. With OpenFlow, entries can be added and removed to the internal flow-table of switches and routers to make the network more responsive to real-time traffic demands. </li>

367. **What are two port types used by a Cisco WLC for *out-of-band management*?(choose two)**

       A. console

       B. service

       C. management

       D. redundant

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>AB</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul>
               <li>Out-of-band (OOB) management is a nodegrid net services method of remotely controlling and managing critical IT assets and network equipment using a secure protocol connection through a secondary interface that is physically separate from the primary network connection. This enables administrators to gain control even during infrastructure faults using remote management.</li>
               <li>The Service Port is used for Out Of Bound (OOB) Management. Whilst the default configuration on the WLC allows for access via the management interface, it is better practice to have the service port configured on a different VLAN and use that to reach the WLC via SSH / HTTPS. The service port is controlled by the service-port interface and is reserved for out-of-band management of the controller and system recovery and maintenance in the event of a network failure. It is also the only port that is active when the controller is in boot mode. The service port is not capable of carrying 802.1Q tags, so it must be connected to an access port on the neighbor switch. Use of the service port is optional.</li>
               <li>Out-of-band management is typically enabled through a serial console port, such as RS-232, which provides a command line interface for troubleshooting routers, servers, switches, power controllers, storage devices and other equipment. This enables administrators to configure, reboot, and reset devices if the primary network becomes unavailable.</li>
           </ul>
       </details>

368. What is the purpose of using the “?”(question mark) with the URI of REST API query?

       C. It prevent the sever from sending any errors in the answer

       D. It precedes the query parameters when performing a GET request

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>D</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul>
               <li>The question mark sign is used to separate path and query parameters. If you want to add multiple query parameters, an '&' sign is placed in between them to form what is known as a query string. It can feature various object types with distinct lengths such as arrays, strings, and numbers.</li>
           </ul>
       </details>

       B. WFQ

       C. PQ

       D. WRED

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>C</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul>
               <li>With First In First Out (FIFO) or Weighted Fair Queueing (WFQ), there is no priority servicing so they are not suitable here.</li>
               <li> With Priority Queueing (PQ), traffic is classified into high, medium, normal, and low priority queues. The high priority traffic is serviced first, then medium priority traffic, followed by normal and low priority traffic.  -> Therefore we can assign higher priority for voice traffic. <br>
       Also with PQ, higher priority traffic can starve the lower priority queues of bandwidth. No bandwidth guarantees are possible -> It is still good because this network is mostly used for data traffic so voice traffic amount is small.</li>
               <li>Weighted Random Early Detection (WRED) is just a congestion avoidance mechanism. WRED measures the size of the queues depending on the Precedence value and starts dropping packets when the queue is between the minimum threshold and the maximum threshold -> It does not have priority servicing either.</li>
           </ul>

       A. IPsec tunnel mode with AH

       B. IPsec transport mode with AH

       C. IPsec tunnel mode with ESP

       D. IPsec transport mode with ESP

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>C</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul><li>IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) is a series of protocols that is used to protect IP traffic between two points on a network. It offers confidentiality, data integrity, and a high degree of security through its advanced packet encryption. For these reasons, IPsec is most commonly used for business VPNs.</li>
               <li>In order to authenticate data packets and guarantee their integrity, IPsec includes two protocols. These are the AH (Authentication Header) protocol and the ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload) protocol. Both protocols, in turn, support two encapsulation modes—tunnel mode and transport mode.</li>
               <li>When AH tunnel mode is used, the entire packet is signed for integrity and authentication. But when ESP tunnel mode is used, the encapsulated packet between the ESP header and the ESP trailer is signed for integrity and authentication. The new packet can also be encrypted for greater security.</li>
               <li>In both ESP and AH cases with IPSec Transport mode, the IP header is exposed.</li>

       D. support the NAT protocol

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>A</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul>
               <li>An RFC1918 address is an IP address that is assigned by an enterprise organization to an internal host. These IP addresses are used in private networks, which are not available, or reachable, from the Internet. In fact, one of the basic requirements of the Internet is that each host has a unique IP address. RFC1918 removes this requirement. RFC1918 IP addresses can be used on multiple networks, as long as they’re private and isolated from each other. To implement this solution every Internet router must be configured to discard IP packets with these addresses. IP packets carrying private addresses can only flow on internal, private networks.</li>
