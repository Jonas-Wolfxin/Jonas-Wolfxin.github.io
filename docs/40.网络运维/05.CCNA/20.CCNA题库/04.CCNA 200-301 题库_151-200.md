151. The `service password-encryption` command is entered on a router. What is the effect of this configuration?

       A. restricts unauthorized users from viewing clear-text passwords in the running configuration

       B. encrypts the password exchange when a VPN tunnel is established

       C. prevents network administrators from configuring clear-text passwords

       D. protects the VLAN database from unauthorized PC connections on the switch

       <details>
           <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
              <strong>A</strong>
              <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
              <ul>
                  <li>All passwords configured on an IOS device, with the exception of the passwords configured with enable secret password, are stored in clear-text in the device configuration file. This means that all that attacker needs to do to find out the passwords is to run the show running-config command. To encrypt them, you can use the service password-encryption global configuration command:</li>
              </ul>
       </details>

152. What occurs to frames during the process of **frame flooding**?

       A. Frames are sent to every port on the switch in the same VLAN except from the originating port

       B. Frames are sent to every port on the switch that has a matching entry in the MAC address table.

       C. Frames are sent to all ports, including those that are assigned to other VLANs.

       D. Frames are sent to every port on the switch in the same VLAN.

153. What is the primary purpose of a **First Hop Redundancy Protocol**?

       A. It allows directly connected neighbors to share configuration information.

       B. It allows a router to use bridge priorities to create multiple loop-free paths to a single destination.

       C. It reduces routing failures by allowing Layer 3 load balancing between OSPF neighbors that have the same link metric.

       D. It reduces routing failures by allowing more than one router to represent itself, as the default gateway of a network.

           <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
              <strong>D</strong>
              <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
              <ul>
                  <li>A first hop redundancy protocol (FHRP) is a computer networking protocol which is designed to protect the <strong>default gateway</strong> used on a subnetwork by allowing two or more routers to provide backup for that address; in the event of failure of an active router, the backup router will take over.</li>

           <li>An 802.1X network is different from home networks in one major way; it has an authentication server called a RADIUS Server. It checks a user's credentials to see if they are an active member of the organization and, depending on the network policies, grants users varying levels of access to the network. This allows unique credentials or certificates to be used per user, eliminating the reliance on a single network password that can be easily stolen.

              <strong>B, E</strong>
              <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
              <ul>To let the serial interfaces on the Atlanta and Washington routers reach other, you need to configure a static host route (on the New York router) which points to the destination IP (to the serial interface of the other router) and goes through the next-hop IP address.
                  <li>For the Washington Lo3, you have to specify a static route to 2000::3/128 (destination IP) through Se0/0/1 on the New York router (or the next-hop IP address): <br> ipv6 route 2000::3/128 2023::3</li>
                  <li>For the Atlanta Lo1, you have to specify a static route to 2000::1/128 (destination IP) through Se0/0/0 on the New York router (or the next-hop IP address):
       <br> ipv6 route 2000::1/128 2012::1</li>

       D. modify network type

       <details>
           <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
              <strong>C</strong>
              <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul>
               <li>Two OSPF routers are neighbors if they are connected to the same subnet and share a series of common configuration information:
       <br>Same Area ID
       <br>Same Area type
       <br>Same subnet mask
       <br>Same timers
       <br>Same authentication
       <br>They see their own OSPF RID in each other's Hello packet
       <br><br>In essence, OSPF neighborhood is a relation of two routers that allows them to see and understand each other but nothing more. <strong></strong></li>
               <li>OSPF will always form an adjacency with the neighbor on the other side of a point-to-point interface such as point-to-point serial lines. There is no concept of DR or BDR.</li>
               <li>OSPF adjacency is formed betwen selected neighbors and allows them to exchange routing information. So, two routers must first be neighbors, only then they can become adjacent. Two routers become adjacent if:
       <br>At least one of them is DR or BDR (on multiaccess type networks), or
       <br>They are interconnected by a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint network type
       <br><br>So, to sum it up, OSPF neighbors are simply routers that sit on the same segment and hear each other, but they do not engage in any closer cooperation. OSPF adjacent routers exchange routing information.</li>

           <li>Root bridge is the switch with lowest BID. The BID (bridge ID) is composed by the switch priority and by its MAC address. Since the question doesn’t mention any priority, just focus on the MAC addresses and compare them “hex value- to-hex value”, starting from left to right: The first two values are equal for all MAC addresses. Starting from the 3rd value, Switch 2 and Switch 3 have a MAC address which is lower than Switch 1 and Switch 4. Starting from the 7th value, you can see that Switch 3 is lower than Switch 4.</li>

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>A</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <p>WSA is a web security appliance, it can do proxy caching.
           </p>
           <ul>
               <li>Caching should be enabled in the web proxy configuration in order to save bandwidth and boost performance. This is becoming less important as the percentage of HTTPS traffic increases because the WSA does not by default cache HTTPS transactions. If the proxy is deployed to serve only explicit clients, forward mode should be specified in order to reject any traffic that isn’t specifically destined for the proxy service. This reduces attack surface in the appliance and follows a good security principle: If you don’t need it, turn it off.
