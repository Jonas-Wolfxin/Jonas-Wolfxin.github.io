       D. One functional physical port is needed to pass client traffic

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>D</strong>
           <em>Explanation: </em>
           <ul>
               <li>Link aggregation (LAG) requires the EtherChannel to be configured for 'mode on' on both the controller and the Catalyst switch.</li>
               <li>Once the EtherChannel is configured as on at both ends of the link, the Catalyst switch should not be configured for either Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) or Cisco proprietary Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) but be set unconditionally to LAG. Because no channel negotiation is done between the controller and the switch, the controller does not answer to negotiation frames and the LAG is not formed if a dynamic form of LAG is set on the switch. Additionally, LACP and PAgP are not supported on the controller.</li>
               <li>When you enable LAG, only one functional physical port is needed for the controller to pass client traffic.</li>

119. What are two reasons for an engineer to configure a **floating static route**? (Choose two.)

       A. to route traffic differently based on the source IP of the packet

       B. to enable fallback static routing when the dynamic routing protocol fails

       C. to automatically route traffic on a secondary path when the primary path goes down

       D. to control the return path of traffic that is sent from the router

       E. to support load balancing via static routing

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>B, C</strong>
           <em>Explanation: </em>
           <ul>
               <li>Floating static routes are static routes that have an administrative distance greater than the administrative distance of dynamic routes. Administrative distances can be configured on a static route so that the static route is less desirable than a dynamic route. In this manner, the static route is not used when the dynamic route is available. However, if the dynamic route is lost, the static route can take over, and traffic can be sent through this alternate route. If this alternate route is provided using a DDR interface, then that interface can be used as a backup mechanism.

       D. CDP

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>B</strong>
           <em>Explanation: </em>
           <p>
               SNMP is an application-layer protocol that provides a message format for communication between SNMP managers and agents. SNMP provides a standardized framework and a common language used for the monitoring and management of devices in a network.
           </p>
           <ul>The SNMP framework has three parts:
               <li>An SNMP manager</li>
               <li>An SNMP agent</li>
               <li>A Management Information Base (MIB)</li>
           </ul>
           The Management Information Base (MIB) is a virtual information storage area for network management information, which consists of collections of managed objects.  With SNMP, the network administrator can send commands to multiple routers to do the backup.

       A. It processes VTP updates from any VTP clients on the network on its access ports.

       B. It receives updates from all VTP servers and forwards all locally configured VLANs out all trunk ports

       C. It forwards only the VTP advertisements that it receives on its trunk ports.

       D. It transmits and processes VTP updates from any VTP Clients on the network on its trunk ports

           <em>Explanation: </em>
           <ul>
               <li>The VTP mode of SW2 is transparent so it only forwards the VTP updates it receives to its trunk links without processing them.</li>
               <li>Transparent—VTP transparent switches do not participate in VTP. A VTP transparent switch does not advertise its VLAN configuration and does not synchronize its VLAN configuration based on received advertisements, but transparent switches do forward VTP advertisements that they receive out their trunk ports in VTP Version 2.</li>

126. Which mode allows access points to be managed by Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers?

       A. autonomous

       B. lightweight

       C. bridge

       D. mobility express

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>B</strong>
           <em>Explanation: </em> <br>
           Cisco Lightweight Access Point (LAP)  The Cisco LAP is part of the Cisco Unified Wireless Network architecture. A LAP is an AP that is designed to be connected to a wireless LAN (WLAN) controller (WLC). The LAP provides dual band support for IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g and simultaneous air monitoring for dynamic, real-time radio frequency (RF) management.  <br> In addition, Cisco LAPs handle time-sensitive functions, such as Layer 2 encryption, that enable Cisco WLANs to securely support voice, video, and data applications.
       <br>
       APs are “lightweight,” which means that they cannot act independently of a wireless LAN controller (WLC). The WLC manages the AP configurations and firmware. The APs are “zero touch” deployed, and individual configuration of APs is not necessary. The APs are also lightweight in the sense that they handle only real-time MAC functionality. The APs leave all the non-real-time MAC functionality to be processed by the WLC. This architecture is referred to as the “split MAC” architecture.

127. Which result occurs when **PortFast** is enabled on an interface that is connected to another switch?

       A. Spanning tree may fail to detect a switching loop in the network that causes broadcast storms

       B. VTP is allowed to propagate VLAN configuration information from switch to switch automatically

       C. Root port choice and spanning tree recalculation are accelerated when a switch link goes down

       D. After spanning tree converges PortFast shuts down any port that receives BPDUs.

           <strong>A</strong>
           <em>Explanation: </em>
           <ul>
               <li>PortFast causes a switch or trunk port to enter the spanning tree forwarding state immediately, bypassing the listening and learning states. ... If you enable PortFast on a port that is connected to another Layer 2 device, such as a switch, you might create network loops. </li>
