      B. FlexConnect AP mode bridges the traffic from the AP to the WLC when local switching is configured.

      C. Local AP mode creates two CAPWAP tunnels per AP to the WLC.

      D. Local AP mode causes the AP to behave as if it were an autonomous AP.

      <details>
       <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
          <strong>C</strong>
          <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
          <ul>
              <li>In local mode, an AP creates two CAPWAP tunnels to the WLC.  One is for <strong>management</strong>, the other is <strong>data traffic</strong>.  This behavior is known as "centrally switched" because the data traffic is switched(bridged) from the AP to the controller where it is then routed by some routing device.</li>
              <li>FlexConnect allows data traffic to be switched locally and not go back to the controller.  It basically causes the AP to behave like an autonomous AP, but be managed by the WLC.  In this mode, the AP can still function even if it looses connection with the controller. </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>Below are the 3 cloud supporting services cloud providers provide to customer:
              <li> <strong>PaaS (Platform as a Service)</strong>: are used for applications, and other development, while providing cloud components to software. PaaS is a framework they can build upon to <strong>develop or customize applications</strong>. PaaS makes the development, testing, and deployment of applications quick, simple, and cost-effective.  As a result, PaaS frees developers from having to install in-house hardware and software to develop or run a new application.</li>
              <li><strong>SaaS (Software as a Service)</strong>: SaaS <strong>uses the web to deliver applications that are managed by a third-party vendor and whose interface is accessed on the clients' side</strong>. Most SaaS applications can be run directly from a web browser without any downloads or installations required, although some require plugins.</li>
              <li><strong>Infrastructure-as-a-Service</strong>With IaaS, a provider supplies the basic compute, storage and networking infrastructure along with the hypervisor -- the virtualization layer. Users must then create virtual instances such as VMs and containers, install OSs, support applications and data, and handle all of the configuration and management associated with those tasks. Some examples of IaaS services are DigitalOcean, AWS, Azure and Google Compute Engine.</li>

      <details>
       <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
          <strong>D</strong>
          <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
      <ol>A router evaluates and selects routes in the following order:
       <li>Prefix Length - The longest-matching route is preferred first. Prefix length trumps all other route attributes.</li>
       <li>Administrative Distance - In the event there are multiple routes to a destination with the same prefix length, the route learned by the protocol with the lowest administrative distance is preferred.</li>
       <li>Metric - In the event there are multiple routes learned by the same protocol with same prefix length, the route with the lowest metric is preferred. (If two or more of these routes have equal metrics, load balancing across them may occur.)</li>
          </ol>

71. what is the default behavior of a **layer 2 switch** when *a frame with an unknown destination MAC address is received*?

      A. The Layer 2 switch forwards the packet and adds the destination MAC address to its MAC address table

      B. The Layer 2 switch sends a copy of a packet to the CPU for destination MAC address learning

      C. The Layer 2 switch floods packets to all ports except the receiving port in the given VLAN

      D. The Layer 2 switch dorps the received frame

      <details>
       <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
          <strong>C</strong>
          <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
          <ul>
              <li>If the destination MAC address is not in the CAM table (unknown destination MAC address), the switch sends the frame out all other ports that are in the same VLAN as the received frame. This is called flooding. It does not flood the frame out the same port on which the frame was received.</li>

88. How do **TCP and UDP** differ in the way they provide reliability for the delivery of packets?

      A. TCP does not guarantee delivery or error checking to ensure that there is no data corruption; UDP provides message acknowledgment and retransmits data if lost.

      B. TCP provides flow control to avoid overwhelming a receiver by sending too many packets at once; UDP sends packets to the receiver in a continuous stream without checking for sequencing.

      C. TCP uses windowing to deliver packets reliably; UDP provides reliable message transfer between hosts by establishing a three-way handshake

      D. TCP is a connectionless protocol that does not provide reliable delivery of data; UDP is a connection-oriented protocol that uses sequencing to provide reliable delivery.

92. An email user has been lured into clicking a link in an email sent by their company's security organization. The webpage that opens reports that it was safe but the link could have contained malicious code. Which type of security program is in place?

      A. Physical access control

      B. Social engineering attack

      C. brute force attack

          <strong>D</strong>
          <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
          <ul>
              <li>This is a training program which simulates an attack, not a real attack (as it says €The webpage that opens reports that it was safe€) so we believed it should be called a €user awareness€ program. Therefore the best answer here should be ג€user awareness€. </li>
              <li>This is the definition of ג€User awarenessג€ from CCNA 200-301 Offical Cert Guide Book: €User awareness: All users should be made aware of the need for data confidentiality to protect corporate information, as well as their own credentials and personal information. They should also be made aware of potential threats, schemes to mislead, and proper procedures to report security incidents. €</li>
              <li>Note: Physical access control means infrastructure locations, such as network closets and data centers, should remain securely locked.</li>

94. Refer to Exhibit. Which action do the switches take on the **trunk link**?

      ![img](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Wolfxin/MyPicGo/img/202207131603286.png)

      A. The trunk does not form and the ports go into an err-disabled status.

      B. The trunk forms but the mismatched native VLANs are merged into a single broadcast domain.

      C. The trunk does not form, but VLAN 99 and VLAN 999 are allowed to traverse the link.

      D. The trunk forms but VLAN 99 and VLAN 999 are in a shutdown state.

      <details>
       <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
          <strong>B</strong>
          <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
          <ul>
              <li>802.1q trunking inserts a four-byte 802.1q tag field into frames sent over the trunk, which contain VLAN information. The 802.1q tag is inserted into each frame transferred over the trunk except for frames transmitted on the native VLAN, which are sent untagged. </li>
              <li>In most cases, the native VLAN has to match on both sides of the trunk unless there is a specific unusual configuration requirement, which is outside the scope of this document. If the native VLANs do not match, the switch will log Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) messages stating the mismatch. While not catastrophic, this setup effectively causes the two different native VLANs to be merged into one larger L2 broadcast domain (VLAN). These two VLANs will attempt to calculate one common Spanning-Tree Protocol (STP) topology for such bridged native VLANs, with the risk of eventually exceeding the maximum supported STP diameter.</li>
              <li>The trunk still forms with mismatched native VLANs and the traffic can actually flow between mismatched switches. But it is absolutely necessary that the native VLANs on both ends of a trunk link match; otherwise a native VLAN mismatch occurs, causing the two VLANs to effectively merge. For example with the above configuration, SW1 would send untagged frames for VLAN 999. SW2 receives them but would think they are for VLAN 99 so we can say these two VLANsare merged.</li>

95. Which IPv6 address block sends packets to a **group address** rather than a single address?

      A. 2000::/3

      B. FC00::/7

      C. FE80::/10

      D. FF00::/8

      <details>
       <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
          <strong>D</strong>
          <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
          <ul>
              <li>FF00::/8 is used for IPv6 multicast and this is the IPv6 type of address the question wants to ask.</li>
              <li>FE80::/10 range is used for link-local addresses. Link-local addresses only used for communications within the local subnetwork (automatic address configuration, neighbor discovery, router discovery, and by many routing protocols). It is only valid on the current subnet. It is usually created dynamically using a link-local prefix of FE80::/10 and a 64-bit interface identifier (based on 48-bit MAC address).</li>

96. Two switches are connected and using **Cisco Dynamic Trunking Protocol**. SW1 is set to **Dynamic Auto** and SW2 is set to **Dynamic Desirable**. What is the result of this configuration?

      A. The link is downstate.

      B. The link is in an error disables state

      C. The link becomes an access port.

      D. The link becomes a trunk port.

      <details>
       <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
          <strong>D</strong>
          <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
          <ul>
              <li><strong>Dynamic Auto</strong> — Makes the Ethernet port willing to convert the link to a trunk link. The port becomes a trunk port if the neighboring port is set to trunk or dynamic desirable mode. This is the default mode for some switchports.</li>
              <li><strong>Dynamic Desirable</strong> — Makes the port actively attempt to convert the link to a trunk link. The port becomes a trunk port if the neighboring Ethernet port is set to trunk, dynamic desirable or dynamic auto mode.</li>

98. Refer to the exhibit. If configuring a *static default route* on the router with the `ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.13.0.1 120` command, how does the router respond?

      ![img](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Wolfxin/MyPicGo/img/202207131617617.png)

      A. It ignores the new static route until the existing OSPF default route is removed

      B. It immediately replaces the existing OSPF route in the routing table with the newly configured static route

      C. It starts load-balancing traffic between the two default routes

100. An engineer must configure a WLAN using the *strongest encryption type for WPA2- PSK*. Which cipher fulfills the configuration requirement?

      A. WEP

      B. RC4

      C. AES

      D. TKIP

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>C</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul>
               <li>Many routers provide WPA2-PSK (TKIP), WPA2-PSK (AES), and WPA2-PSK (TKIP/AES) as options.</li>
               <li>TKIP is actually an older encryption protocol introduced with
       WPA to replace the very-insecure WEP encryption at the time. TKIP is actually quite similar to WEP encryption. TKIP is no longer considered secure, and is now deprecated. In other words, you shouldn't be using it.</li>
               <li>AES is a more secure encryption protocol introduced with WPA2 and it is currently the strongest encryption type for WPA2-PSK.</li>
