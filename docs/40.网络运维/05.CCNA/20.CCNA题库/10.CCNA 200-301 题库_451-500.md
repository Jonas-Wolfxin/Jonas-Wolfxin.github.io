           <strong>A</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul>
               <li>The PC's port runs in full duplex, while the Fa0/1 port on the switch is in auto-negotiate mode. This results in a duplex mismatch that causes the switchport to operate as half-duplex, which culminates in poor performance on the link.</li>
               <li>"A duplex mismatch occurs when two connected devices are configured in different duplex modes.
       This may happen, for example, if one is configured for autonegotiation while the other one has a fixed mode of operation that is full duplex (no autonegotiation). In such conditions, the autonegotiation device correctly detects the speed of operation, but is unable to correctly detect the duplex mode.
       As a result, it sets the correct speed but assumes half-duplex mode.
       When a device is operating in full duplex while the other one operates in half duplex, the connection works reliably only at a very low throughput."</li>
