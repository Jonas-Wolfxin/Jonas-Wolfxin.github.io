       Trusted and Untrusted Sources

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>C</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
       <ul>
       <li>The DHCP snooping feature determines whether traffic sources are trusted or untrusted. An untrusted source may initiate traffic attacks or other hostile actions. To prevent such attacks, the DHCP snooping feature filters messages and rate-limits traffic from untrusted sources. </li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       <li>In an enterprise network, devices under your administrative control are trusted sources. These devices include the switches, routers and servers in your network. Any device beyond the firewall or outside your network is an untrusted source. Host ports are generally treated as untrusted sources. </li>
       <li>In a service provider environment, any device that is not in the service provider network is an untrusted source (such as a customer switch). Host ports are untrusted sources. </li>
       <li>In the Catalyst 6500 series switch, you indicate that a source is trusted by configuring the trust state of its connecting interface. </li>
       <li>The default trust state of all interfaces is untrusted. You must configure DHCP server interfaces as trusted. You can also configure other interfaces as trusted if they connect to devices (such as switches or routers) inside your network. You usually do not configure host port interfaces as trusted. </li>
       <li>Note: For DHCP snooping to function properly, all DHCP servers must be connected to the switch through trusted interfaces, as untrusted DHCP messages will be forwarded only to trusted interfaces.</li>
       </ul>

506. Which PoE mode **enables powered-device detection** and **guarantees** power when the device is detected?

       A. dynamic

       B. static

       C. active

       D. auto

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>B</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul>
               <li>auto—Enables powered-device detection. If enough power is available, automatically allocates power to the PoE port after device detection. This is the default setting.</li>
               <li>never —Disables device detection, and disable power to the port.
               <p>
                   If a port has a Cisco powered device connected to it, do not use the power inline never command to configure the port. A false link-up can occur, placing the port into the error-disabled state.
                   </p></li>
               <li>static—Enables powered-device detection. Pre-allocate (reserve) power for a port before the switch discovers the powered device. The switch reserves power for this port even when no device is connected and guarantees that power will be provided upon device detection.</li>
           </ul>

       Which command set must the engineer apply?
       A.

516. Which protocol uses the SSL?

       A. HTTP

       B. SSH

       C. HTTPS

       D. Telnet

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>C</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul>
               <li>SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer and, in short, it's the standard technology for keeping an internet connection secure and safeguarding any sensitive data that is being sent between two systems, preventing criminals from reading and modifying any information transferred, including potential personal details. The two systems can be a server and a client (for example, a shopping website and browser) or server to server (for example, an application with personal identifiable information or with payroll information).</li>
               <li>HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure) appears in the URL when a website is secured by an SSL certificate. The details of the certificate, including the issuing authority and the corporate name of the website owner, can be viewed by clicking on the lock symbol on the browser bar.</li>
               <li>TLS (Transport Layer Security) is just an updated, more secure, version of SSL. We still refer to our security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, but when you are buying SSL from DigiCert you are actually buying the most up to date TLS certificates with the option of ECC, RSA or DSA encryption.</li>

517. Which value is the **unique identifier that an access point uses to establish and maintain wireless connectivity to wireless network devices**?

       B. SSID

       C. RFID

       D. WLANID

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>B</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul>
               <li>An SSID is a unique identifier used by a client to establish a connection to a particular wireless network. When devices within a network need to communicate with each other, they need to identify the WLAN. Identification is handled through a unique value given to that WLAN, known as the SSID.</li>
