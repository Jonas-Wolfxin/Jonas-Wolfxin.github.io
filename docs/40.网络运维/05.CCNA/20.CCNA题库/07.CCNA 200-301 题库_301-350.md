       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>B</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul>
               <li>In a controller-based network architecture, the controller needs to communicate to the networking devices. In most network drawings and architecture drawings, those network devices typically sit below the controller, as shown in Figure 16-5. There is an interface between the controller and those devices, and given its location at the bottom part of drawings, the interface came to be known as the southbound interface

303. Which switch technology establishes a network connection immediately when it is plugged in?

       A. PortFast

       B. BPDU guard

       C. UplinkFast

       D. BackboneFast

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>A</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul>
               <li>UplinkFast provides the immediate shift to alternate port by determining the possible paths going to the Root Switch (Root Bridge). The collection of possible paths going to the Root Switch (Root Bridge) are called uplink group. When UplinkFast is enabled, Root Port transitions to the Forwarding State immediately without going through the Listening State and Learning State, as in normal Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) Operation.</li>

304. What causes a port to be placed in the **err-disabled state**?

       A. latency

       B. port security violation

       C. shutdown command issued on the port

       D. nothing plugged into the port

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>B</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul>
               <li>This mode is the default violation mode; when in this mode, the switch will automatically force the switchport into an error disabled (err-disable) state when a violation occurs. While in this state, the switchport forwards no traffic. The switchport can be brought out of this error disabled state by issuing the errdisable recovery cause CLI command or by disabling and reenabling the switchport.</li>

        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>A</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul>
               <li>The only indicator of any issues here is the reliability 166/255 on SiteA. When the input and output errors increase, they affect the reliability counter. This indicates how likely it is that a packet can be delivered or received successfully. Reliability is calculated like this: reliability = number of packets / number of total frames. The value of 255 is the highest value meaning that the interface is very reliable at the moment. The calculation above is done every 5 minutes.</li>

322. Which technology is appropriate for communication between an SDN controller and **applications** running over the network?

       A. OpenFlow

       B. REST API

       C. NETCONF

       D. Southbound API

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>B</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul>
               <li>The northbound interface in SDN is the communication between the highest application layer and the SDN controller at the middle control layer. The application layer consists of network orchestration services, networking designer software, operator software or third-party applications that make decisions about the overall structure of the network. In SDN, the operator or orchestration software does not directly issue commands or configurations to the network nodes. Instead, the operator uses the application layer to issue commands to the control layer over the northbound interface. The northbound interface is often a REpresentational State Transfer API, or REST API, exposed by the SDN controller.</li>
               <li>The southbound interface in SDN is the communication between the SDN controller at the middle control layer and the lower networking elements at the data layer. The data layer consists of the physical or virtual network switches and ports.</li>
               <p>The SDN controller takes the desired state of the network and translates it into specific commands and configurations that are then pushed to the network devices over the southbound interface.</p>
               <p>Popular southbound interface standards are Simple Network Management Protocol, or <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/SNMP">SNMP</a>; <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/OpenFlow">OpenFlow</a>; and Open Shortest Path First, or <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/OSPF-Open-Shortest-Path-First">OSPF</a>.</p>
               <li>A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms(符合) to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. REST stands for representational state transfer and was created by computer scientist Roy Fielding.</li>

       D. sending and receiving OSPF Hello packets

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>A</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul>
               <li>Data Plane is consist of various Network devices both physical and Virtual. The main duty of data plane is Forwarding. In the previous traditional networks, both control and data plane was in the same device. But with SDN, network devices has only data plane. So, the main role of these network devices is only Forwarding the data. This provide a very efficient Forwarding mechanims.</li>

       D. Enable the Protected Management Frame service and set the Comeback timer to 10

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>D</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul>
               <li>A while Security Association is an excellent added protection with Association Comeback, this answer is wrong as the SA Query retry value is between 100 to 500 ms
       SA teardown protection is a mechanism to prevent replay attacks from tearing down the session of an existing client. It consists of an Association Comeback Time and an SA-Query procedure preventing spoofed association requests from disconnecting an already connected client. <a href="https://content.cisco.com/chapter.sjs?uri=/searchable/chapter/content/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/9800/config-guide/b_wl_16_10_cg/802-11w.html.xml" target="_blank">https://content.cisco.com/chapter.sjs?uri=/searchable/chapter/content/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/9800/config-guide/b_wl_16_10_cg/802-11w.html.xml</a></li>
               <li>B is not as effective with hardening the controller and AP association requests at an enterprise level. <a href="https://www.portnox.com/blog/network-security/the-truth-about-mac-spoofing/" target="_blank">https://www.portnox.com/blog/network-security/the-truth-about-mac-spoofing/</a></li>
               <li>C 802.1x is secure, encrypted and effective for client authentication especially with RADIUS config. However 802.1x/802.11x are not as specifically robust as the Protected Management Frame service mechanism and processes on WLC with 802.11w.</li>

341. Which plane is centralized by an SDN controller?

       A. management-plane

       B. control-plane

       C. data-plane

       D. services-plane

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>B</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul>
               <li>A controller, or SDN controller, centralizes the control of the networking devices. The degree of control, and the type of control, varies widely. For instance, the controller can perform all control plane functions, replacing the devices’ distributed control plane. Alternately, the controller can simply be aware of the ongoing work of the distributed data, control, and management planes on the devices, without changing how those operate. And the list goes on, with many variations.</li>

342. **Which function is performed by *DHCP snooping*?**

       A. propagates VLAN information between switches

       B. listens to multicast traffic for packet forwarding

       C. provides DDoS mitigation

       D. rate-limits certain traffic

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>D</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul>
               <li>DHCP Snooping is a layer 2 security technology incorporated into the operating system of a capable network switch that drops DHCP traffic determined to be unacceptable. DHCP Snooping prevents unauthorized (rogue) DHCP servers offering IP addresses to DHCP clients.</li>
           </ul>
           <p>DHCP snooping is a security feature that acts like a firewall between untrusted hosts and trusted DHCP servers. The DHCP snooping feature performs the following activities: </p>
       <ul>
       <li>Validates DHCP messages received from untrusted sources and filters out invalid messages. </li>
       <li>Rate-limits DHCP traffic from trusted and untrusted sources. </li>
       <li>Builds and maintains the DHCP snooping binding database, which contains information about untrusted hosts with leased IP addresses. </li>
       <li>Utilizes the DHCP snooping binding database to validate subsequent requests from untrusted hosts.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Other security features, such as dynamic ARP inspection (DAI), also use information stored in the DHCP snooping binding database. </p>
       <p>DHCP snooping is enabled on a per-VLAN basis. By default, the feature is inactive on all VLANs. You can enable the feature on a single VLAN or a range of VLANs. </p>
       <p>The DHCP snooping feature is implemented in software on the MSFC. Therefore, all DHCP messages for enabled VLANs are intercepted in the PFC and directed to the MSFC for processing. </p>

343. A network administrator is asked to configure VLANs 2, 3, and 4 for a new implementation. Some ports must be assigned to the new VLANS with unused remaining. **Which action should be taken for the unused ports**?

       A. configure port in the native VLAN

       B. configure ports in a black hole VLAN

       C. configure in a non-default native VLAN

       D. configure ports as access ports

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>B</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul>
               <li>Some administrators take unused ports a step further by creating a black hole VLAN. This is a VLAN that's local to this switch only, has no layer 3 switch virtual interface (SVI) configured for it, and isn't allowed to traverse an uplink trunk port </li>
           </ul>

           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul>
               <li>Interfaces with portfast enabled that come up will go to forwarding mode immediately, the interface will skip the listening and learning state.</li>
               <li>A switch will never generate a topology change notification for an interface that has portfast enabled.</li>

346. An engineer configures interface Gi1/0 on the company PE router to connect to an ISP. Neighbor discovery is disabled. Which action is necessary to complete the configuration **if the ISP uses third-party network devices**?

       ![img](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Wolfxin/MyPicGo/img/202207180428603.png)

       A. Enable LLDP globally

       B. Disable auto-negotiation

       C. Disable Cisco Discovery Protocol on the interface

       D. Enable LLDP-MED on the ISP device

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>A</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul>
               <li>Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) is a layer 2 neighbor discovery protocol that allows devices to advertise device information to their directly connected peers/neighbors. It is best practice to enable LLDP globally to standardize network topology across all devices if you have a multi-vendor network.</li>

347. What must be considered when using **802.11a**?

       A. It is compatible with 802 lib- and 802 11-compliant wireless devices

       B. It is used in place of 802 11b/g when many non-overlapping channels are required

       C. It is susceptible(易受影响的) to interference from 2.4 GHz devices such as microwave ovens.

       D. It is chosen over 802 11b/g when a lower-cost solution is necessary

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>B</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul>
               <li> 802.11a and 802.11b are not compatible since 802.11a operates at the 5GHz frequency band and 802.11b operates at the 2.4GHz band. </li>
               <li>The 2.4 GHz frequency band with a channel width of 22 MHz only has 3 non-overlapping channels (1, 6 and 11) whereas the 5 GHz band has 23 non-overlapping channels with a 20 MHz channel width. </li>
               <li>Therefore, 802.11a is preferred over 802.11b and 802.11g when many non-overlapping channels are required since they both operate at 2.4GHz unlike 802.11a.</li>
