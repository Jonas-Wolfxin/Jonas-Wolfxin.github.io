402. What is a syslog facility?

       A. Host that is configured for the system to send log messages

       B. password that authenticates a Network Management System to receive log messages

       C. group of log messages associated with the configured severity level

       D. set of values that represent the processes that can generate a log message

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>D</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul>
               <li>The facility represents the machine process that created the Syslog event. For example, in the event created by the kernel, by the mail system, by security/authorization processes, etc.? In the context of this field, the facility represents a kind of filter, instructing SMS to forward to the remote Syslog Server only those events whose facility matches the one defined in this field. So by changing the facility number and/or the severity level, you change the number of alerts (messages) that are sent to the remote Syslog server</li>
               <li>The Facility value is a way of determining which process of the machine created the message. Since the Syslog protocol was originally written on BSD Unix, the Facilities reflect the names of UNIX processes and Daemons.</li>
           </ul>

           <strong>AD</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul>
               <li>The SSID is a unique identifier that wireless networking devices use to establish and maintain wireless connectivity. The SSID can consist of up to 32 alphanumeric, case-sensitive, characters.</li>
           </ul>
       </details>

409. **In QoS, which prioritization method is appropriate for *interactive voice and video*?**

       A. expedited forwarding

       B. traffic policing

       C. round-robin scheduling

       D. low-latency queuing

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>D</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul>
               <li>Low Latency Queuing (LLQ) is the preferred queuing policy for VoIP audio. Given the stringent delay/jitter sensitive requirements of TP and the need to synchronize audio and video for CUVA, priority (LLQ) queuing is the recommended for all video traffic as well. Note that, for video, priority bandwidth is generally fudged up by 20% to account for the overhead.</li>
               <li>Low Latency Queuing LLQ adds strict priority to the CBWFQ and allows delay sensitive data (Voice and Video) to be dequeued and sent before lower priority packets. This practice gives delay sensitive data preferential treatment over other traffic. To direct traffic to the LLQ, use the priority command for the class after the named class within a policy map is specified. Any class of traffic can be attached to a service policy, which uses priority scheduling, and that traffic can be prioritized over other class traffic.</li>
           </ul>
       </details>

410. Refer to the exhibit. Which change to the configuration on Switch allows the two switches to establish an **EtherChannel**?

       A. Change the protocol to EtherChannel mode on.

       B. Change the LACP mode to active

       C. Change the LACP mode to desirable

       D. Change the protocol to PAgP and use auto mode

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>B</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul>
               <li>Mode Passive: The mode places a port into a passive negotiating state, in which the port responds to LACP packets that it receives but does not initiate protocol negotiation.</li>
               <li>Mode Active: The mode places a port into an active negotiating state, in which the port initiates negotiations with other ports by sending LACP packets.</li>
               <li>Mode On: All static EtherChannels, that is, the port is not running LACP messaging but static bundling. With this mode, the switch or the other end switch will not recognize any problem with the EtherChannel and will not tell about the problem.</li>
           </ul>

427. An engineer must establish a trunk link between two switches. The neighboring switch is set to **trunk or desirable mode**. What action should be taken?

       A. configure switchport nonegotiate

       B. configure switchport mode dynamic desirable

       C. configure switchport mode dynamic auto

       D. configure switchport trunk dynamic desirable

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>B & C both are correct</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul>
               <li>switchport mode dynamic auto: Makes the interface able to convert the link to a trunk link. The interface becomes a trunk interface if the neighboring interface is set to trunk or desirable mode. The default switchport mode for newer Cisco switch Ethernet interfaces is dynamic auto. Note that if two Cisco switches are left to the common default setting of auto, a trunk will never form.</li>
               <li>switchport mode dynamic desirable: Makes the interface actively attempt to convert the link to a trunk link. The interface becomes a trunk interface if the neighboring interface is set to trunk, desirable, or auto mode.</li>
           </ul>

           <em>Explanation: </em>
           <ul>
               <li>Local mode -This is default mode of lightweight access point. In local mode lightweight access point acts as if controller and AP are in same location. And it sends all the traffic (control and data) to controller. If we loose connection to controller, access point will dissociate
               <p>

                   </p></li>
               <li>Flex-connect mode -This is a mode where AP join the controller but switch data packet locally.In this mode AP and controller could be or could not be on same site. Flex connect mode with we can have more resiliency as even if we loose connection to controller. AP continues serving the existing associated clients.

                   </p></li>
               <li>Sniffer Mode – It is the mode required to take over the air packet captures. In this mode AP listens the communication between nearby client and AP.To capture the traffic AP listens on specific channel. We need to set the AP in sniffer mode.

                   </p></li>
               <li>Monitor Mode– AP in this mode is dedicated for scanning the rogue devices all the time. This can only detect wireless rogues devices. In monitor mode AP does not serve the clients. <p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Wolfxin/MyPicGo/img/202207182031702.png" alt="img" style="zoom:80%;" />
                   </p> </li>
               <li>Rogue Mode– This mode is also for detecting the rogue devices on wired network. This AP connects to wired infrastructure using trunk port and listens for all the traffic coming from all vlans. If there is any mac address declared as rogue device by another AP than this AP reports it to controller. And it can also trigger the alerts for rogue devices.<p>  <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Wolfxin/MyPicGo/img/202207182032931.png" alt="img" style="zoom:80%;" />

442. **What is a capability of *FTP* in network management operations?**

       A. encrypts data before sending between data resources

       B. devices are directly connected and use UDP to pass file information

       C. uses separate control and data connections to move files between server and client

       D. offers proprietary support at the session layer when transferring data

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>C</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul>
               <li>Control Connection: The control connection uses very simple rules for communication. Through control connection, we can transfer a line of command or line of response at a time. The control connection is made between the control processes. The control connection remains connected during the entire interactive FTP session.</li>
               <li>Data Connection: The Data Connection uses very complex rules as data types may vary. The data connection is made between data transfer processes. The data connection opens when a command comes for transferring the files and closes when the file is transferred.</li>

449. **What is a function of *Opportunistic Wireless Encryption* in an environment?**

       A. offer compression

       B. increase security by using a WEP connection

       C. provide authentication

       D. protect traffic on open networks

       <details>
        <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
           <strong>D</strong>
           <p><em>Explanation: </em></p>
           <ul>
               <li>Opportunistic wireless encryption uses a secret key to encrypt Internet sessions hosted on open Wi-Fi networks. Public Wi-Fi networks with no required password or authentication process are convenient, especially for users who are on the go or need to quickly access their bank account or work email. <br> But they’re also extremely susceptible to hacking, particularly man-in-the-middle attacks, where a third-party attacker intercepts the four-way handshake process and pretends to be the main parties. Opportunistic wireless encryption (OWE) removes much of attackers’ opportunity to intercept the handshake process and gain access to a user’s Internet activity.</li>
               <li>Instead of using a public pre-shared key (PSK), in which the handshake process can easily be hacked, OWE uses a Diffie-Hellman encryption key exchange, creating a unique key for the two parties. After the key exchange is successful, the networks perform a four-way handshake before finalizing and enabling an encrypted connection.</li>
