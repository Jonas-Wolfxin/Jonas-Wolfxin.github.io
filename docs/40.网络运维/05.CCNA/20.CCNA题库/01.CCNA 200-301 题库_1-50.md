      <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
         <strong>A</strong>
     <br>Explanation: 
         <ul><li>CDP is already enabled on Cisco devices by default. </li>
             <li>In order to ensure discovery in a multivendor network, you would need to enable LLDP on the Cisco devices; it isn't enabled by default, and it can be run on non-Cisco devices, where CDP can't be.</li>
         </ul>
     </details>

3.   When a **site-to-site VPN** is used, which protocol is responsible for the transport of user data?

     A. IKEv2

     B. IKEv1

     C. IPsec

     D. MD5

     <details>
      <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
         <strong>C</strong>
         <em>Explanation: </em>
         <ul><li>IPsec The term referring to the IP Security protocols, which is an architecture for providing encryption and authentication services, usually when creating VPN tunnel through an IP network.
     Site-to-site IPSec VPNs offer scalability as a benefit. This is because each remote office only needs an Internet connection to create a VPN tunnel back to the main office. </li>
             <li>A site-to-site VPN allows offices in multiple fixed locations to establish secure connections with each other over a public network such as the Internet. A site-to-site VPN means that two sites create a VPN tunnel by encrypting and sending data between two devices. One set of rules for creating a site-to-site VPN is defined by IPsec.</li>
         </ul>
     </details>

     E. when a collision occurs after the 32nd byte of a frame has been transmitted

     <details>
      <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
         <strong>B, C</strong>
         <em>Explanation: </em>
         <ul><li>A late collision is defined as any collision that occurs after the first 512 bits (or 64th byte) of the frame have been transmitted. The usual possible causes are 			<ol>
             <li>full- duplex/half-duplex mismatch,  </li>
             <li>exceeded Ethernet cable length limits, </li>

9.   When a **floating static route** is configured, which action ensures that the **backup route is used when the primary route fails**?

     A. The floating static route must have a higher administrative distance than the primary route so it is used as a backup

     B. The administrative distance must be higher on the primary route so that the backup route becomes secondary.

     C. The floating static route must have a lower administrative distance than the primary route so it is used as a backup

     D. The default-information originate command must be configured for the route to be installed into the routing table

     <details>
      <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
         <strong>A</strong>
         <em>Explanation: </em>
         <ul>
             <li>By default, IOS considers static routes better than OSPF-learned routes. By default, IOS gives static routes an administrative distance of 1. </li>
             <li>A floating static route floats or moves into and out of the IP routing table depending on whether the better (lower) administrative distance route learned by the routing protocol happens to exist currently.</li>
         </ul>
     </details>

10.   Which mode must be used to *configure EtherChannel between two switches without using a negotiation protocol*?

      A. on

      B. auto

      C. active

      D. desirable

      <details>
       <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
          <strong>A</strong>
          <em>Explanation: </em>
          <ul>
              <li><em>on</em> 
                  <br>Mode that forces the LAN port to form Etherchannel without using negotiation protocol. In the on mode, a usable EtherChannel exists only when a LAN port group in the on mode is connected to another LAN port group in the on mode. Because ports configured in the on mode do not negotiate, there is no negotiation traffic between the ports. You cannot configure the on mode with an EtherChannel protocol. If one end uses the on mode, the other end must also.</li>
              <strong>PAgP 协议</strong>
              <li><em>auto</em> 
                  <br>PAgP mode that places a LAN port into a passive negotiating state, in which the port responds to PAgP packets it receives but does not initiate PAgP negotiation. (Default)</li>
              <li><em>desirable</em>  
                  <br>PAgP mode that places a LAN port into an active negotiating state, in which the port initiates negotiations with other LAN ports by sending PAgP packets.</li>
              <strong>LACP 协议</strong>
              <li><em>passive</em>  
                  <br>LACP mode that places a port into a passive negotiating state, in which the port responds to LACP packets it receives but does not initiate LACP negotiation. (Default)</li>
              <li><em>active</em>
                  <br>LACP mode that places a port into an active negotiating state, in which the port initiates negotiations with other ports by sending LACP packets.</li>

11.   What are two descriptions of **three-tier network topologies**? (Choose two.)

      A. The distribution layer runs Layer 2 and Layer 3 technologies.

      B. The network core is designed to maintain continuous connectivity when devices fail.

      C. The core layer maintains wired connections for each host.

      D. The core and distribution layers perform the same functions

      E. The access layer manages routing between devices in different domains.

      <details>
       <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
          <strong>A, B</strong>
          <em>Explanation: </em>
          <ul>
              <li>Access: Provides a connection point (access) for end-user devices. Does not forward frames between two other access switches under normal circumstances.</li>
              <li>Distribution: Provides an aggregation point for access switches, providing connectivity to the rest of the devices in the LAN, forwarding frames between switches, but not connecting directly to end-user devices.
      The distribution layer is where redistribution of routing protocols should be performed. It should never be performed at the core or access layer.</li>
              <li>Core: Aggregates distribution switches in very large campus LANs, providing very high forwarding rates for the larger volume of traffic due to the size of the network.
      Only switching between campus (distribution) switches should be performed at the core layer. Nothing should be done to slow down forwarding of traffic, such as using ACLs, supporting clients, or routing between VLANs.
      Core layer switches are commonly set up in a star topology. This is because core layer switches connect multiple campuses via distribution layer switches</li>
          </ul>

      D. The MAC address of the interface is used as the interface ID without modification

      <details>
       <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
          <strong>A</strong>
          <em>Explanation: </em>
          <ul>
              <li>EUI-64 (Extended Unique Identifier) is a method we can use to automatically configure IPv6 host addresses. An IPv6 device will use the MAC address of its interface to generate a unique 64-bit interface ID. However, a MAC address is 48 bit and the interface ID is 64 bit. What are we going to do with the missing bits?
              <ol>
                  <li>Split Mac Address in to two ( 00:BB:CC | DD:11:22)</li>
                  <li> Insert FFFE Hexa in the middle, Eg: 00:BB:CC:DD:11:22 --> 02BB:CCFF:FEDD:1122</li>
                  <li>Invert the 7th Bit of the MAC address (0 to 1)</li>

22.   which command must be entered when a device is configured as an **NTP server**?

      A. ntp master

      B. ntp sever

      C. ntp authenticate

      D. ntp peer

      <details>
       <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
          <strong>A</strong>
          <em>Explanation: </em>
          <ul>
              <li>To configure a Cisco device as an Authoritative NTP Server, use the ntp master [stratum] command. the device acts only as an NTP server, and not as an NTP client. The device gets its time information from the internal clock on the device.</li>
              <li>To configure a Cisco device as a NTP client, use the command ntp server [IP address]. First, it acts as an NTP client, to synchronize time with a server. Once synchronized, the device could then act as an NTP server, to supply time to other NTP clients. For example: 
                  <br>Router(config)#ntp server 192.168.1.1
                  <br>This command will instruct the router to query 192.168.1.1 for the time.</li>

          <ul>
              <li>With a spine-and-leaf architecture, no matter which leaf switch to which a server is connected, its traffic always has to cross the same number of devices to get to another server (unless the other server is located on the same leaf). This approach keeps latency at a predictable level because a payload only has to hop to a spine switch and another leaf switch to reach its destination.</li>
              <li>In this two-tier Clos architecture, every lower-tier switch (leaf layer) is connected to each of the top-tier switches (spine layer) in a full-mesh topology. The leaf layer consists of access switches that connect to devices such as servers. The spine layer is the backbone of the network and is responsible for interconnecting all leaf switches. Every leaf switch connects to every spine switch in the fabric. The path is randomly chosen so that the traffic load is evenly distributed among the top-tier switches. If one of the top tier switches were to fail, it would only slightly degrade performance throughout the data center.</li>

       <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
          <strong>C</strong>
          <em>Explanation: </em>
          <ul>
              <li>Spine-leaf architecture is typically deployed as two layers: spines (such as an aggregation layer), and leaves (such as an access layer). Spine-leaf topologies provide high-bandwidth, low-latency, nonblocking server-to-server connectivity.</li>
              <li>Leaf (aggregation) switches are what provide devices access to the fabric (the network of spine and leaf switches) and are typically deployed at the top of the rack. Generally, devices connect to the leaf switches. Devices can include servers, Layer 4-7 services (firewalls and load balancers), and WAN or Internet routers.
      Leaf switches do not connect to other leaf switches. In spine-and-leaf architecture, every leaf should connect to every spine in a full mesh.</li>
              <li>Spine (aggregation) switches are used to connect to all leaf switches and are typically deployed at the end or middle of the row. Spine switches do not connect to other spine switches.</li>

      ![img](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Wolfxin/MyPicGo/img/0013400001.png)

      A. It selects RIP route because it has the longest prefix inclusive of the destination address

      B. It chooses the EIGRP route because it has the lowest administrative distance

      C. It load-balances traffic between all three routes

      D. It chooses the OSPF route because it has the longest prefix inclusive of the destination address

      <details>
       <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
          <strong>A</strong>
          <em>Explanation: </em>
          <ul>
              <li>The router can't use the network OSPF because it's another network and not include the destination address (192.168.12.0/28 --> from 192.168.12.0 to 192.168.12.15). </li>
              <li>The correct answer is A because the RIP route use a /27 subnet and include the destination address (192.168.12.0/27 --> from 192.168.12.0 to 192.168.12.31).</li>

49.   Which *two actions* are performed by the **Weighted Random Early Detection mechanism**?(Choose two)

      A. It drops lower-priority packets before it drops higher-priority packets

      B. It can identify different flows with a high level of granularity

      C. It guarantees the delivery of high-priority packets

      D. It can mitigate congestion by preventing the queue from filling up

      E. IT supports protocol discovery

      <details>
       <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
          <strong>A, D</strong>
          <em>Explanation: </em>
          <p>
              Weighted Random Early Detection (WRED) is just a congestion avoidance mechanism. WRED drops packets selectively based on IP precedence. Edge routers assign IP precedences to packets as they enter the network. When a packet arrives, the following events occur:
      <br>1. The average queue size is calculated.
      <br>2. If the average is less than the minimum queue threshold, the arriving packet is queued.
      <br>3. If the average is between the minimum queue threshold for that type of traffic and the maximum threshold for the interface, the packet is either dropped or queued, depending on the packet drop probability for that type of traffic.
      <br>4. If the average queue size is greater than the maximum threshold, the packet is dropped.
      <br><br>WRED reduces the chances of tail drop (when the queue is full, the packet is dropped) by selectively dropping packets when the output interface begins to show signs of congestion (thus it can mitigate congestion by preventing the queue from filling up). By dropping some packets early rather than waiting until the queue is full, WRED avoids dropping large numbers of packets at once and minimizes the chances of global synchronization. Thus, WRED allows the transmission line to be used fully at all times.
      <br><br>WRED generally drops packets selectively based on IP precedence. Packets with a higher IP precedence are less likely to be dropped than packets with a lower precedence. Thus, the higher the priority of a packet, the higher the probability that the packet will be delivered.

50.   Which set of action satisfy the requirement for **multi-factor authentication**?

      A. The user swipes a key fob, then clicks through an email link

      B. The user enters a user name and password, and then clicks a notification in an authentication app on a mobile device

      C. The user enters a PIN into an RSA token, and then enters the displayed RSA key on a login screen

      D. The user enters a user name and password and then re-enters the credentials on a second screen

      <details>
       <summary>Correct Answer</summary>
          <strong>B</strong>
          <em>Explanation: </em>
          <p>This is an example of how two-factor authentication (2FA) works:</p>
          <ol>
              <li>The user logs in to the website or service with their username and password.</li>
              <li>The password is validated by an authentication server and, if correct, the user becomes eligible for the second factor.</li>
              <li>The authentication server sends a unique code to the user's second-factor method (such as a smartphone app).</li>
              <li>The user confirms their identity by providing the additional authentication for their second-factor method.</li>
          </ol>
          multi factor can be 2 of the 3:
          <ol>
              <li>something you know - password, pin</li>
              <li>something you have - card, badge</li>
              <li>something you are - retina, voice, facial recognition</li>
          </ol>
